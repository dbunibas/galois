**Danny Ings scored in the 95th minute to rescue a point for West Ham against Fulham at Craven Cottage.**

Ings was introduced as a last throw of the dice by manager Julen Lopetegui in the 82nd minute as he saved the Hammers from a second consecutive defeat.

Captain Jarrod Bowen did brilliantly to find the striker in the box in the final minutes and Ings needed one touch to set himself before firing beyond keeper Bernd Leno.

Calvin Bassey thought he had won it for Fulham a minute later but he put his free header wide of the post.

Raul Jimenez gave Fulham the lead in the 24th minute with a composed first time finish from eight yards out.

Emile Smith Rowe proved influential once again with his run beyond the Hammers' back line timed to perfection before putting the ball on a plate for Jimenez.

Fulham felt as though they should have been awarded a penalty before the deadlock was broken but referee Tim Robinson judged Max Kilman's challenge on Adama Traore to be fair.

Lopetegui looked to his substitutes bench at half-time after his side failed to register a shot on goal in the opening period.

The arrival of Lucas Paqueta and Crysencio Summerville added some attacking intensity before the Hammers eventually found a way past Leno.

Bowen found space in the box but his bundled effort was met by the outstretched leg of Leno.

Fulham 1-1 West Ham: Lopetegui praises players' belief and fighting spirit after late goal

The Lopetegui era has got off to a stuttering start with one win, one draw and two defeats in his opening four Premier League games, but there are reasons to be optimistic.

However, that last minute equaliser from Ings may feel like progress in some sense and the Hammers can take huge positives from the fighting spirit shown late on.

Lopetegui’s arrival signalled a change in how the Hammers would shape up and that was evident in spells.

Bowen showed how influential he is for West Ham after he moved into the number nine role for the second half.

The England international worked tirelessly all game despite it looking as though things would not go the way of his side and he came away with an assist.

As Pep Guardiola said after Manchester City’s 3-1 win at the London Stadium before the international break: “It is a question of time and he \[Lopetegui\] will do it.”

There are signs of Guardiola being correct.

Fulham 1-1 West Ham: Marco Silva reaction

Eyebrows were raised when Fulham completed the initial £27 million signing of Smith Rowe from Arsenal in the summer window.

The 24-year-old opened his Fulham account before the international break in the 1-1 draw at Ipswich and he registered his first assist for his new side against the Hammers.

Marco Silva’s side are tidy in possession with the likes of Andreas Pereira and Alex Iwobi in midfield but Smith Rowe adds more of a cutting edge in the attacking third.

He showed his intelligence when timing his run to perfection for Jimenez’s goal before finding the composure to lift his head on the touchline and pick out the run of his team-mate so he could slot beyond Alphonse Areola.

Smith Rowe would have scored his second goal in Fulham colours but his powerful, goal bound effort could only strike Jimenez in the stomach.

The Fulham fans stood to applaud their new hero when he was substituted in the second half, they know they have a brilliant player on their hands.
