Newcastle midfielder Joelinton scored two Premier League goals last season

**Joelinton's goal secured a hard-fought opening-day victory for 10-man Newcastle over newly promoted Southampton in an ill-tempered match at St James' Park.**

A dreadful pass from Saints goalkeeper Alex McCarthy gifted the ball to striker Alexander Isak, who set up Brazil midfielder Joelinton to score with Newcastle's only shot on target just before half-time.

That goal came 17 minutes after home defender Fabian Schar had been shown a red card for going head-to-head with Ben Brereton Diaz, after he had been shoved in the back by the Southampton forward.

Brereton Diaz dropped to the ground after minimal contact from Schar and referee Craig Pawson sent off the Swiss defender.

Schar's red card galvanised St James' Park as the noise levels rose and Eddie Howe's side dug deep to defend waves of Southampton attacks.

Tempers flared even further at half-time with both sets of players pushing and shoving in the tunnel.

In a more subdued second half, Southampton came agonisingly close to equalising through Brereton Diaz but Lewis Hall's sublime clearance off the line kept the Magpies' clean sheet intact.

Southampton had 19 shots to Newcastle's three but failed to find an equaliser.

Newcastle 1-0 Southampton: Eddie Howe reaction

## Newcastle eye more European football

Newcastle’s Champions League adventure came to an end in the group stage last season and returning to European football's biggest competition will be their target this season.

Eddie Howe's team and their fans enjoyed away days at the likes of Paris St-Germain and AC Milan, but Manchester United's FA Cup victory meant Newcastle's seventh-place finish last season was not enough for European football.

The bonus is that they start this season with a lighter, more manageable schedule and, in the form of players such as Isak, Anthony Gordon, and Bruno Guimaraes, have a squad capable of again challenging at the top end of the table.

Keeping hold of their stars was key for Howe this summer and the push to strengthen his squad continues, with several bids for Crystal Palace's England defender Marc Guehi rejected.

Next up is a trip to Bournemouth on Sunday 25 August as Newcastle look to make it back-to-back victories.

Newcastle 1-0 Southampton: Russell Martin reaction

## Positives for Southampton in defeat

Losing to 10 men after dominating possession will be hugely disappointing for Southampton manager Russell Martin but there are positives to take from his side's performance.

Saints controlled the game even before Newcastle lost a player and they ended the first half with 70% possession.

The disappointment will come in the way they conceded after a lapse of concentration from McCarthy.

Like last season in the Championship, Southampton played a possession-based game and stuck to their plan throughout the 90 minutes.

With better finishing, they could have left the North East with at least a point and have reason for optimism heading into a home game against Nottingham Forest next week.
