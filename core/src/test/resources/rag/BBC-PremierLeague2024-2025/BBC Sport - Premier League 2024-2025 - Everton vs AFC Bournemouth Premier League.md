MOTD Analysis: How Bournemouth changed the game after 86 minutes

Steve Sutcliffe

BBC Sport journalist

**Bournemouth produced an extraordinary late fightback as they came from two goals down after 86 minutes to beat shell-shocked Everton in the Premier League at Goodison Park.**

Everton had deservedly looked on course to register their first win of the season and a first in August for three years.

However, they self-destructed spectacularly as the Cherries scored three times in nine chaotic minutes to spark joyous scenes among visiting players and supporters.

Antoine Semenyo's tap-in from Dango Ouattara's left-wing cross to make it 2-1 looked little more than a consolation for the visitors, who trailed to second-half goals from Michael Keane and Dominic Calvert-Lewin.

Instead it signalled a complete capitulation from the hosts, who were suddenly left holding on for a point when Luis Sinisterra crossed for Cherries captain Lewis Cook to level two minutes into added time.

But the Toffees crumbled to their third consecutive defeat when another delivery, this time from Justin Kluivert on the left, was nodded in by Sinisterra four minutes later to give Bournemouth the sweetest of victories.

The incredible turnaround ensured Everton stay bottom of the table and became the first club in Premier League history to lose a game after having a two-goal advantage in the 87th minute.

## Celebration turns to rancour at Goodison

Marcus Tavernier's 20-yard effort in the 82nd minute had represented lacklustre Bournemouth’s only shot on target until Semenyo's goal that initiated the stunning conclusion.

In fact, with the final whistle looming it had seemed Sean Dyche's only complaint would be that his side's two-goal advantage scarcely did justice to their dominance.

Keane's goal shortly after the break was a worthy reward for their control, with the central defender driving the ball past Bournemouth's on-loan Chelsea goalkeeper Kepa Arrizabalaga from Calvert-Lewin's lay-off.

Returning captain Seamus Coleman should really have doubled the lead instead of blazing a gilt-edged opportunity over from 10 yards before Calvert-Lewin lifted the ball over debutant Kepa to add Everton's second.

At that stage, with summer signing Iliman Ndiaye impressing and the hosts carving out chance after chance, there was a celebratory mood inside Goodison.

However, that atmosphere quickly transformed to one of rancour, with boos ringing round the ground at full-time after another painful defeat.

## Bournemouth capitalise on vulnerable hosts

Outplayed throughout this encounter, Bournemouth boss Andoni Iraola could scarcely believe what he had just witnessed at the final whistle.

However, he will be delighted at the way his team pressed forward late on to expose a vulnerable Everton side, who look like they have forgotten how to win.

Iraola can also be credited for trying to go on the offensive as his side struggled, with the introduction of Ouattara and Sinisterra proving key to the final outcome.

Burkina Faso winger Ouattara's assist allowed Semenyo to give the visitors hope, then the Colombia winger delivered an assist and a goal as the Cherries' breathtaking fightback moved them up to seventh in the table.
