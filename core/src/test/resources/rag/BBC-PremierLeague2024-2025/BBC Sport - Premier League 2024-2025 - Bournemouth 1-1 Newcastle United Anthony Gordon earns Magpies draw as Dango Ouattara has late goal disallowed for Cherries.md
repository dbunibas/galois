Bournemouth boss Andoni Iraola was left hugely frustrated by the decision to rule out Dango Ouattara's late goal

Gary Rose

BBC Sport journalist

**Bournemouth boss Andoni Iraola says he was "the most frustrated" he has been as a manager after his side had a stoppage-time winner against Newcastle controversially ruled out by the video assistant referee.**

Substitute Dango Ouattara thought he had secured a 2-1 victory for the Cherries with a 93rd-minute strike but it was disallowed for handball - with the ball deemed to have come off his upper arm, rather than his shoulder, before going in.

"It's the most frustrated I've been on a touchline," said Iraola, who was booked for his protests.

"I went to talk to the referee but I think the referee cannot do much more. He gave the goal. \[VAR\] didn't give him the chance to see it again.

"He heard me complain but it's not against him. He cannot do much more. He's not the one who made a mistake today.

"I understand the rule \[and\] they will try to make me think there is a part of reasoning there - but I completely don't agree. It's just common sense.

"Anyone who has played football and looks at the strength of the ball when it touches the back of the net knows that's not handball, it's a shoulder."

Marcus Tavernier had given Bournemouth a deserved first-half lead when he turned in Antoine Semenyo's cross.

Bournemouth's club record signing Evanilson, who was making his debut, should have made the points safe in the second half but failed to get a touch to Semenyo's dangerous cross.

Newcastle had been flat for large periods of the match but they improved in the closing stages and, after Neto kept out Joelinton's header, Anthony Gordon got the equaliser when he prodded in Harvey Barnes' cross at the far post.

It set up a tense finish as both sides chased a winner, Semenyo going closest with a deflected strike before Dan Burn's header was superbly pushed away by Neto.

With seconds left, it was Bournemouth fans who were cheering but their celebrations were cut short when Ouattara's effort was ruled out, leaving the Cherries still searching for a first win of the season.

"I thought the game was lost because I initially hadn't seen anything wrong with the goal," said Newcastle boss Eddie Howe.

"We have had it both ways. We have had it for us and against us and we are very grateful for that moment because we have battled hard.

"What we had at that stage of the game was a valuable point. But I understand that it is a contentious decision."

'We have very short sleeves'- Andoni Iraola on handball decision

A draw was arguably a fair result, with Bournemouth having the better of the first half and Newcastle coming alive in the second.

But nevertheless it was a cruel blow for the Cherries, with Iraola incensed by the decision to wipe off Ouattara's header.

Initially, David Coote had awarded the goal but the video assistant referee intervened, having deemed Ouattara to have handled the ball as he headed in.

There was more drama to follow as Joelinton appeared to haul down Neto by the neck as the Bournemouth goalkeeper tried to release the ball quickly.

But the Newcastle man escaped with a yellow card, before a member of the Bournemouth coaching staff was sent off for their reaction to the decision.

"It was probably as bit reckless from Joelinton," added Howe. "You could see what he is trying to do - he's trying to stop the keeper - but you can't go near the head area. That's something we will talk to him about."

Despite the late blow for Bournemouth there were some encouraging signs.

Semenyo was a threat throughout and his assist added to his goal in the Cherries' draw with Nottingham Forest in their opening game.

Meanwhile, Evanilson - tasked with replacing Dominic Solanke's goals following his departure - showed flashes of promise, getting into some good positions, even if his finishing was a little rusty.

But it will be difficult for Bournemouth fans to take solace from those positives following the dramatic conclusion to the game.

Draw with Bournemouth 'fair' but 'frustrating' - Eddie Howe

Newcastle finished seventh last season as injuries and a lack of squad depth hampered their challenge for a top-four finish, but they will have hopes of putting up a stronger fight this time.

They know they will need to be significantly stronger defensively, particularly on the road after they lost 11 of their 19 away games last season.

The first-half display in this game will have rightly given Newcastle fans cause for concern as they barely troubled Bournemouth, while the opener came from a mistake by Joelinton.

But they were much improved after the break, with the introduction of Kieran Trippier - who has been linked with a move away from the club - appearing to inspire their revival, with his experience and leadership adding stability to the Newcastle backline.
