All four of Christopher Nkunku's Premier League goals have come as a substitute

Adam Millington

BBC Sport journalist

**Substitute Christopher Nkunku netted a late goal to snatch a 1-0 away win for Chelsea at Bournemouth in a game with a Premier League record 14 yellow cards.**

The Cherries had the bulk of the chances and their £40m record signing Evanilson missed an excellent opportunity to score his first Premier League goal when he had a poor first-half penalty parried away by Robert Sanchez.

Bournemouth constantly tormented Chelsea's defence, with both Marcus Tavernier and Ryan Christie having efforts denied by the woodwork.

But they were made to pay by Nkunku, who prodded the ball past Mark Travers after a through-ball from debutant Jadon Sancho.

It was a hard-fought and aggressive encounter, with referee Anthony Taylor handing out more yellow cards than ever before in a Premier League match.

The six bookings for Bournemouth and eight for Chelsea eclipsed the previous record of 12 handed out in Chelsea v Tottenham in 2016 and Wolves v Newcastle in 2010.

"It is not a problem for me with this amount of yellow cards," Chelsea boss Enzo Maresca said. "It is what it is.

"Sometimes the game demands the way you have to behave."

Chelsea, who move up to seventh, will play West Ham at 12:30 BST next Saturday in their next Premier League game, while 11th-placed Bournemouth will visit Liverpool at 15:00 BST later that day.

Bournemouth 0-1 Chelsea: Andoni Iraola reaction

Bournemouth's previous Premier League game saw a spectacular late fightback as they beat Everton after being two goals down on 86 minutes - and they began with similar vigour on Saturday.

Tavernier struck the crossbar within the opening few minutes as Andoni Iraola's side took the game to Chelsea, charging into their third and making the most of a disjointed visiting defence.

The Cherries produced some neat final-third moves, with Tavernier and Justin Kluivert instrumental in a significant amount of the link-up play.

Their midfield did well defensively, too, with Christie and Lewis Cook performing to a high standard to shut down many of Chelsea's attempts to play through the lines.

There were, however, shortcomings in their play. Bournemouth had the better chances, but they found converting them into clear-cut opportunities difficult.

That ultimately proved costly for Iraola's men, who had 19 shots and seven on target without scoring.

Bournemouth 0-1 Chelsea: Enzo Maresca reaction

There were promising elements in Chelsea's performance, but the game equally exposed a number of issues for manager Maresca - especially in their defence.

Chelsea were often sloppy in their attempts to build up, failing to sustain possession and instead gifting Bournemouth chances. It was only the hosts' final product that prevented the visitors from conceding.

There were some good moments for Chelsea, particularly in their forward movement. But they struggled to adequately express themselves, instead making nice moves that resulted in little of note until Nkunku notched the late winner.

Nicolas Jackson earlier spurned an excellent chance to snatch the lead, firing straight to the palms of Travers when slipped through one-on-one.

Introducing Manchester United loanee Sancho at half-time proved crucial, with his footwork carving out opportunities before he eventually delivered the all-important through-ball to set up Nkunku.
