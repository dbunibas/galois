Ollie Watkins scored two goals against Everton last weekend

**Aston Villa scored two late goals as a frantic finish helped Unai Emery's side beat rivals Wolves at Villa Park.**

Wolves had been the better side in the first half and took the lead in the 25th minute through Matheus Cunha after the winger had intercepted Diego Carlos' sloppy pass.

But the home side, who won on their return to the Champions League in midweek, woke up in the 73rd minute when striker Ollie Watkins was played in by Morgan Rogers and equalised with a deflected effort.

Defender Ezri Konsa completed Villa's turnaround in the 88th minute, meeting Youri Tielemans' superb cross with a sliding finish.

The home side rounded off their win on the break, as substitute Jhon Duran scored his fourth goal of the season deep into injury time by tapping in a Rogers pass across goal.

## Villa shake off European hangover

Villa's match really started in the 73rd minute when they finally shook off their European hangover and levelled through Watkins' third goal in as many matches.

After the equaliser, Villa Park expected a winner.

Emery's side have tasted victory in all their matches bar one this season, which was itself a battling defeat by title challengers Arsenal.

The hosts pushed for a second and were rewarded by unlikely scorer Konsa sliding in for his first goal since he netted against Wolves in March.

Duran's goal on the break - incredibly his fourth this season without starting a fixture - flattered the hosts, but Villa are now a team who find a way to win even when they play badly.

They move up to third in the Premier League - level on points with leaders Liverpool and Manchester City, who welcome Arsenal on Sunday.

Villa were marking their first home match since the death of former player Gary Shaw and tributes were made to the European Cup winner throughout Saturday afternoon.

The home side were without captain John McGinn for the second half after he picked up a knock, and was replaced by Ian Maatsen.

Next up for Villa is League One side Wycombe in the EFL Cup, before they take on Ipswich away in the league on Sunday.

## Tough Wolves start continues

Wolves have lost back-to-back league fixtures against Villa for the first time since 2003-04.

A win over one of their arch-rivals could have been the spark they needed to turn their form around.

Gary O'Neil's side have just one win across their past 15 Premier League matches - including 11 defeats - their worst run for more than two years.

However, with matches against Chelsea, Arsenal and Newcastle, it is fair to say their opening fixtures have been particularly tough.

Their only point this season came at Nottingham Forest, and they were knocked out of the EFL Cup by Brighton in midweek.

Frustratingly for Wolves, they had the measure of their opponents for 70 minutes, winning the ball back with a high press - a tactic which resulted in their opener.

Cunha still had work to do when he intercepted the ball just outside the Villa box, but his strike, going in off the near post, was immaculate.

Wolves had gone close to a second just before the break when Rayan Ait-Nouri's close-range effort deflected narrowly wide off Carlos' calf.

But the visitors were ultimately made to pay for their wasted chances.

Meanwhile, defender Yerson Mosquera was taken off on a stretcher with a knee injury in the second half.

Wolves continue their tricky run as they host Liverpool in their next match in the Premier League, next Saturday.
