Nottingham Forest have drawn with Bournemouth, Newcastle and Wolves at home in all competitions this season

**Nottingham Forest maintained their unbeaten start to the Premier League season by drawing with Wolves at the City Ground.**

Chris Wood gave Forest an early lead when he nodded in unchallenged from a corner but Wolves' Jean-Ricner Bellegarde responded immediately with a stunning strike from range.

With minutes remaining, Wood thought he had found a winner when he struck it past debutant keeper Sam Johnstone from another corner but he was offside.

Both teams showed attacking intent throughout, with Morgan Gibbs-White coming close for Forest and Matheus Cunha a threat at the other end.

It was a battling performance from the hosts, who have picked up five points from their opening three matches but are still seeking a first win at home this season.

Wolves, beaten heavily at home by Chelsea last week, showed more solidity in defence and plenty of flair in attack.

Deadline day signing Johnstone had a busy debut and was tested by Wood on several occasions, but he produced a smart stop to deny the striker in the second half.

## Wood busy as Johnstone shows capability

It was an entertaining afternoon in Nottingham as Forest's new signing James Ward-Prowse watched on in the stands as his side pressed for a winner late on.

Wolves had caused them problems but Forest, boosted by the introduction of substitute Ramon Sosa - on for his Premier League debut - continued to find space out wide.

Fresh from his call-up to the England senior squad, Gibbs-White pulled the strings, while Elliot Anderson was impressive alongside him in Forest's midfield.

Wood was often the target man and he was heavily involved, testing Johnstone and causing problems in the air.

He was fortunate not to have conceded a penalty in the second half when the ball hit his arm as he tracked Craig Dawson, but the striker also had cause for an appeal in the first half when he appeared to be elbowed by Jorgen Strand Larsen.

Wolves have struggled so far this season but this was a far more encouraging display, and Bellegarde's blistering equaliser was their first goal scored from outside the penalty area in 47 Premier League matches.

Johnstone showed glimpses of why he was brought in on deadline day but Jose Sa's absence from the squad will only intensify rumours of a move away from Wolves.

Gary O'Neil's men are now up and running in the league and this was a well-earned point away from home.
