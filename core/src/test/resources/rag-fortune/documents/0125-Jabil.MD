**Jabil: A Resilient Player in the Technology Sector**

In the 2024 Fortune ranking, Jabil secured the 125th position, a slight decline from its previous year's ranking, with a change of -4.0. Despite this drop, the company remains a significant player in the Technology sector, specifically in the Semiconductors and Other Electronic Components industry. With a market value of $13,080 million as of August 5, 2024, and a market capitalization of $17,084.7 million as of March 28, 2024, Jabil continues to demonstrate its financial stability.

Under the leadership of CEO Michael K. Dastoor, Jabil has maintained its profitability, with revenues of $34,702 million and profits of $818 million for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2023. Although the company experienced a decline in profits, with a 17.9% decrease, its revenue growth remained steady, with a 3.7% increase. The company's total assets stood at $19,424 million, reflecting its robust financial foundation.

Jabil's global presence is underscored by its inclusion in the Global 500 and its recognition as one of the World's Most Admired Companies. With a significant workforce of 236,000 employees, the company has established itself as a major employer in the technology sector. However, it is worth noting that the company did not experience growth in jobs, which may be an area of focus for future development.

Headquartered in St. Petersburg, Florida, Jabil operates as a public company, with its website (https://www.jabil.com) providing a platform for stakeholders to access information about the company. As a well-established player in the industry, Jabil's commitment to innovation and excellence is evident in its continued presence in the Fortune rankings.

Despite the decline in ranking, Jabil's resilience and adaptability in the dynamic technology sector are testaments to its ability to navigate challenges and maintain its position as a leading company in the industry. As the company continues to evolve and grow, it will be interesting to observe its future performance and its response to the ever-changing landscape of the technology sector.
