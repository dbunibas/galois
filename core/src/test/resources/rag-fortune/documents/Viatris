**Company Profile: Viatris**

Viatris, a prominent player in the health care sector, specifically in the pharmaceuticals industry, secured the 267th spot in the Fortune 2024 ranking. As a publicly traded company, Viatris operates under the ticker symbol VTRS. The organization has demonstrated its profitability and has witnessed growth in jobs, reflecting its commitment to expansion and development.

Headquartered in Canonsburg, Pennsylvania, Viatris boasts a significant employee base of approximately 38,000 individuals. The company's market value stood at $14,179.6 million as of March 28, 2024, with an updated market value of $14,180 million as of June 4, 2024. Viatris' revenue for the period reached $15,426.9 million, albeit experiencing a 5.1% decline in revenue. The company's profit for the period was $54.7 million, which, however, represented a substantial 97.4% decrease compared to the previous year.

The decline in Viatris rank by 11 positions from the previous year to the 267th spot in the Fortune 2024 ranking may indicate a need for strategic adjustments to maintain its market presence and profitability. Notably, the company has not been recognized as one of the World's Most Admired Companies or among the Best Companies to Work For.

Under the leadership of CEO Scott A. Smith, Viatris continues to navigate the complexities of the pharmaceutical industry. Despite not being a newcomer to the Fortune 500, the company's performance over the past year may warrant a reevaluation of its business strategy to regain lost ground. The company's assets, totaling $47,685.5 million, provide a solid foundation for potential growth and innovation.

As Viatris moves forward, it will be essential to monitor its progress in addressing the challenges that contributed to the decline in revenue and profitability. By leveraging its substantial resources and workforce, the company may be able to reposition itself for success in the competitive pharmaceuticals industry.
