**Company Profile: Murphy USA**

In the latest Fortune 2024 rankings, Murphy USA secured the 214th spot, a decline of 32 positions from its previous standing. As a prominent player in the retailing sector, specifically in the specialty retailers category, the company continues to demonstrate its resilience despite challenges in the industry.

Founded by none of its current leadership, Murphy USA is led by CEO R. Andrew Clyde, who has navigated the company through various market fluctuations. The absence of a female CEO and the company's non-founder leadership dynamic have not hindered its growth, as evidenced by its current market value of approximately $8.727 billion as of March 28, 2024. This valuation places the company firmly in the public domain, with a significant presence in the retail landscape.

One notable aspect of Murphy USA's performance is its employee base, which comprises 10,750 individuals. This workforce has experienced growth, a testament to the company's ability to adapt and expand in a competitive environment. Despite this positive trend, the company's ranking has dropped, largely due to a decline in revenues and profits.

Murphy USA reported revenues of $19.238 billion, a 9.5% decrease from the previous year. This downward trend is also reflected in the company's profits, which stood at $556.8 million, a 17.3% decrease. The company's assets, valued at $4.340 billion, provide a foundation for potential future growth and recovery.

Headquartered in El Dorado, Arkansas, Murphy USA maintains a strong presence in the U.S. market. Despite not being recognized as one of the World's Most Admired Companies or one of the Best Companies to Work For, the company's commitment to its employees and customers remains a crucial aspect of its operations.

As the retail landscape continues to evolve, Murphy USA's ability to adapt and innovate will be essential in determining its future success. With its established market presence and dedicated workforce, the company is poised to navigate the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead.
