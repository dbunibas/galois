**Lithia Motors: A Rising Force in the Automotive Retailing Industry**

In the latest Fortune 2024 ranking, Lithia Motors secured the 140th position, a notable improvement from its previous standing, having gained five places in the overall list. This upward trajectory is a testament to the company's sustained efforts to expand its operations and reinforce its market presence.

Headquartered in Medford, Oregon, Lithia Motors operates as a public company specializing in automotive retailing and services. Led by CEO Bryan B. DeBoer, the company has demonstrated its resilience in a competitive industry, registering revenues of $31,310.9 million in the latest financial year. Although this represents a 10.6% increase in revenue, profits declined by 20.0% to $1,000.8 million.

One of the key drivers of Lithia Motors' growth has been its strategic approach to job creation. The company has experienced a significant increase in its workforce, with the current employee count standing at 25,051. This not only underscores the company's commitment to job creation but also highlights its ability to attract and retain skilled talent in the industry.

As of March 28, 2024, Lithia Motors' market value stood at $8,283.0 million, reflecting the company's robust financial foundation. The company's assets, valued at $19,632.5 million, provide a further indication of its financial stability and capacity for future growth.

While Lithia Motors has not been featured in the Fortune Global 500 or the World's Most Admired Companies lists, its performance in the latest ranking is a clear indication of its emergence as a significant player in the automotive retailing industry. With its strong market presence, expanding workforce, and commitment to growth, Lithia Motors is poised to continue its upward trajectory in the years to come.
