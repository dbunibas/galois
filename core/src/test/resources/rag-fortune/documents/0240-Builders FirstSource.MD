**Company Profile: Builders FirstSource**

In the 2024 Fortune rankings, Builders FirstSource secured the 240th position, marking a notable decline from its previous standing. The company, listed under the ticker symbol BLDR, operates within the Materials sector, specifically in the Building Materials, Glass industry. As a testament to its resilience, Builders FirstSource remained profitable despite the challenging business landscape.

Founded by individuals other than its current CEO, Dave Rush, the company has a well-established presence in the market. Notably, its leadership is not headed by a female CEO, which is an aspect that the company may consider in its future leadership development and diversity initiatives.

In terms of employment, Builders FirstSource boasts a substantial workforce of approximately 29,000 employees, indicating its significant presence in the industry. However, the company did not experience growth in jobs, which may be a concern in light of the overall decline in its ranking.

Builders FirstSource's ranking dropped by 68 positions from its previous standing, reflecting the challenges the company faced in the period leading up to the 2024 rankings. This decline suggests that the company may need to reassess its strategies to regain its competitive edge.

Despite its drop in ranking, the company maintains a substantial market capitalization of $25.43 billion as of March 28, 2024, and $25.431 billion as of the updated market value on June 4, 2024. Its revenues, however, decreased by 24.8% to $17.097 billion, while its profits declined by 44.0% to $1.541 billion. The company's assets stood at $10.499 billion.

Headquartered in Irving, Texas, Builders FirstSource operates as a public company, with its website available at https://www.bldr.com. The company's presence in the United States is well-established, but it did not make it to the Global 500, World's Most Admired Companies, or Best Companies to Work For lists.

In conclusion, while Builders FirstSource remains a significant player in the Building Materials, Glass industry, its decline in ranking and revenue and profit decreases indicate areas that require attention and strategic reevaluation to regain its competitive position in the market.
