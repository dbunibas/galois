**Fortune 2024: Oneok Sees Mixed Results Amidst Industry Challenges**

Ranked 232 in the prestigious Fortune 2024 list, Oneok, a leading player in the Energy sector's Pipelines industry, continues to navigate the complex landscape of the energy market. With its headquarters in Tulsa, Oklahoma, the company has a long history of providing vital energy infrastructure services to the United States.

Despite a decline in ranking by 59 positions compared to the previous year, Oneok remains a profitable entity, with a market value of approximately $46.75 billion as of March 28, 2024. The company's CEO, Pierce H. Norton II, has been instrumental in steering the organization through the challenges posed by the rapidly evolving energy landscape.

Oneok's revenue for the year stood at $17.677 billion, representing a decline of 21% from the previous year. However, the company's profits saw a significant increase of 54.4% to $2.659 billion, indicating a successful effort to optimize operations and improve profitability.

The company's growth in jobs is a welcome trend, with a workforce of 4,775 employees as of the latest available data. This growth is a testament to Oneok's commitment to investing in its human capital and maintaining its position as a major player in the industry.

Oneok's recent acquisition of Magellan Midstream Partners in September 2023 is a significant development that has contributed to its current market position. This strategic move has expanded the company's capabilities and further solidified its presence in the energy sector.
