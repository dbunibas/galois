Its assets stand at $6.601 billion, demonstrating a stable financial foundation.

The company's decline in rank and revenue can be attributed to various market factors, including fluctuations in the housing market and the competitive landscape of the homebuilding industry. Nevertheless, NVR's commitment to its core business and its experienced leadership team, under the guidance of CEO Eugene J. Bredow, position the company for future growth and success.

As a prominent player in the homebuilding industry, NVR continues to navigate the challenges and opportunities presented by the ever-evolving market landscape.
