**Fortune 2024 Ranking: ManpowerGroup Sees Decline in Rankings Despite Remaining Profitable**

In the 2024 Fortune rankings, ManpowerGroup, a leading player in the Temporary Help industry within the Business Services sector, secured the 219th position, representing a decline of 17 places from its previous ranking. This decrease, despite the company's profitable status, suggests a challenging business environment in the sector.

Founded in the U.S. and headquartered in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, ManpowerGroup operates as a public company with a market capitalization of $3,756.3 million as of March 28, 2024. The company's market value has been relatively stable, with a slight decrease to $3,756.0 million by June 4, 2024. Under the leadership of CEO Jonas Prising, ManpowerGroup employs approximately 27,900 individuals, contributing to the country's labor market.

In terms of financial performance, ManpowerGroup generated $18,914.5 million in revenues in the reported period, representing a decline of 4.6% from the previous year. This decrease in revenue is concerning, but the company's ability to remain profitable is a testament to its resilience. The company reported profits of $88.8 million, albeit with a significant decline of 76.2% year-over-year. The substantial decrease in profits raises concerns about the company's ability to sustain profitability in the long term.

ManpowerGroup's assets stood at $8,830.2 million, indicating a substantial presence in the industry. However, the decrease in revenue and profits suggests that the company needs to re-evaluate its strategies to regain its footing and drive growth. The company's website, https://www.manpowergroup.com, provides further information on its services and operations.

In conclusion, ManpowerGroup's ranking in the Fortune 2024 list reflects the challenges faced by the company in the Temporary Help industry. While the company's profitable status is a positive indicator, the decline in revenue and profits, coupled with a drop in rankings, raises concerns about its future performance. As the company navigates the complex business landscape, it will be essential for ManpowerGroup to adapt and innovate to regain its position in the industry.
