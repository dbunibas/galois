**Hess Corporation: A Leader in the Energy Sector**

In the 2024 Fortune ranking, Hess Corporation, a prominent player in the energy sector, secured the 378th position. As a publicly traded company listed under the ticker symbol HES, Hess operates in the mining and crude-oil production industry.

Headquartered in New York, the company is led by CEO John B. Hess, who has been instrumental in navigating the company through the ever-changing landscape of the energy sector. Despite not being a founder-led organization, Hess has demonstrated its ability to adapt and evolve, as evident from its growth in jobs.

However, the company experienced a decline in its ranking, dropping 20 positions from the previous year. This downward shift can be attributed to the challenges faced by the energy sector, which has been marred by fluctuations in global demand and supply. As a result, Hess reported a revenue decline of 8.0%, with revenues standing at $10,645 million as of the latest available data.

Notwithstanding the decline in revenue, Hess remains a profitable entity, with profits of $1,382 million. While this represents a 34.1% decline from the previous year, the company's ability to maintain profitability in a challenging environment is a testament to its resilience.

In terms of market value, Hess boasts a significant market capitalization of $46,883.7 million as of March 28, 2024. This valuation is reflective of the company's substantial assets, which total $24,007 million. The company's market value has been updated to $46,884 million as of June 4, 2024, indicating a minor adjustment in its valuation.

With a workforce of 1,756 employees, Hess continues to be a significant player in the energy sector. As the company navigates the complexities of the industry, its commitment to growth and adaptation will be crucial in determining its future success.

Despite not featuring in the Global 500, World's Most Admired Companies, or Best Companies to Work For lists, Hess remains a notable entity in the energy sector. As the company looks to the future, its ability to innovate and respond to changing market conditions will be essential in driving growth and profitability.
