**Fortune 2024: Fannie Mae's Continued Ascendancy in the Financial Sector**

This year's Fortune ranking sees Fannie Mae, a stalwart in the diversified financials industry, climb to the 27th position. The organization's consistent growth and impressive performance metrics have solidified its standing as a formidable player in the financial landscape.

Headquartered in Washington, District of Columbia, Fannie Mae boasts an extensive workforce of 8,100 employees, reflecting a notable increase in jobs over the past year. This upward trend underscores the company's commitment to expanding its operational capacity and talent pool.

Under the leadership of CEO Priscilla Almodovar, one of the few female CEOs in the industry, Fannie Mae has demonstrated a remarkable ability to navigate the complexities of the financial market. Almodovar's guidance has been instrumental in driving the company's growth, with revenues reaching an impressive $141,240 million, marking a 16.2% increase from the previous year. This significant revenue expansion has, in turn, contributed to a substantial 34.7% rise in profits, totaling $17,408 million.

Fannie Mae's financial health is further evidenced by its substantial assets, valued at $4,325,437 million, and its market value, which stood at $1,818.2 million as of March 28, 2024. However, as of July 15, 2024, the company's market value had surged to $8,585 million, demonstrating a remarkable upswing in its market capitalization.

As a publicly traded company, Fannie Mae's financial performance is closely scrutinized by investors and analysts alike. The organization's senior preferred stock is owned by the U.S. Treasury, which also holds a warrant to purchase 79.9% of the common stock. This unique arrangement underscores the company's critical role in the U.S. financial system.

Fannie Mae's ranking is a testament to its resilience and adaptability in an increasingly competitive financial landscape. The company's ability to innovate, expand its operations, and maintain a strong financial footing has earned it a coveted spot among the Fortune 2024 rankings. As a member of the Global 500, Fannie Mae continues to play a vital role in shaping the global financial landscape.
