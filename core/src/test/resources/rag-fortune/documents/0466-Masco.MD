**Masco: A Household Products Leader Faces Challenges in a Shifting Market Landscape**

In the 2024 Fortune ranking, Masco Corporation secured the 466th position, marking a significant decline of 30 spots from its previous year's ranking. As a prominent player in the Household Products sector, specifically in the Home Equipment, Furnishings industry, the company's drop in rank raises questions about its ability to adapt to an evolving market.

Founded in 1929, Masco has established itself as a stalwart in the industry, but its leadership structure does not reflect a founder-led ethos, with Keith J. Allman at the helm as CEO. Notably, the company's leadership team does not feature a female CEO.

Masco's workforce consists of approximately 18,000 employees, a number that has not experienced significant growth in recent times, as indicated by the lack of job growth. Despite this, the company remains committed to its operations, with its headquarters located in Livonia, Michigan.

From a financial perspective, Masco's performance is a mixed bag. The company's market value, as of March 28, 2024, stood at $17.335 billion, with revenues totaling $7.967 billion. However, a year-over-year revenue decline of 8.2% raises concerns about the company's ability to maintain its market share. On the other hand, Masco's profits have shown resilience, with a 7.6% increase in profits, amounting to $908 million.

The company's assets, valued at $5.363 billion, provide a foundation for future growth and investment. As a publicly traded entity, Masco's financials are subject to scrutiny, and its market value has been updated to $17.335 billion as of June 4, 2024.

Despite facing challenges in recent times, Masco remains a significant player in the Household Products sector. The company's commitment to its core business and its ability to adapt to shifting market trends will be crucial in determining its future success. As the market continues to evolve, Masco's leadership will be under pressure to drive growth and restore the company's upward momentum.
