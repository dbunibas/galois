According to the Fortune 2024 ranking, DXC Technology ranks 294th among the top 500 companies, with a notable decline of 39 positions from the previous year. This change in ranking is primarily attributed to the company's recent struggles in maintaining revenue growth and profitability.

As a leading player in the Information Technology Services sector, DXC Technology operates under the ticker symbol DXC and is classified as a public company. Headquartered in Ashburn, Virginia, the company boasts a significant workforce of 130,000 employees, spread across various locations. Led by CEO Raul J. Fernandez, DXC Technology has established itself as a prominent player in the technology industry, with a market value of $3.878 billion, as of March 28, 2024.

Furthermore, the company's profits took a hit, with a net loss of $568 million, resulting in a staggering 179.1% decline in profits. This downward trend has raised concerns among investors and has contributed to the company's decline in ranking.

Despite these challenges, DXC Technology remains a significant player in the technology sector, with total assets valued at $15.845 billion. The company's market value, as of March 28, 2024, stood at $3.879 billion, reflecting the market's cautious optimism about its future prospects.

In conclusion, DXC Technology's performance, as reflected in the Fortune 2024 ranking, highlights the company's struggles in maintaining revenue growth and profitability. While the company remains a significant player in the technology sector, its future prospects depend on its ability to navigate the challenges ahead and revamp its strategy to drive growth and profitability.
