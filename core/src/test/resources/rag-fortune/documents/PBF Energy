**Fortune 2024 Report: PBF Energy Falls to 112th Rank Amid Challenging Market Conditions**

PBF Energy, a leading player in the petroleum refining industry, dropped to the 112th position in the Fortune 2024 ranking, down 20 spots from the previous year. This decline is reflective of the challenges faced by the energy sector, which has been grappling with fluctuating market conditions and intense competition.

Despite the drop in ranking, PBF Energy remains a significant player in the industry, with a market value of $6.86 billion as of March 28, 2024. However, this value has since decreased to $4.79 billion as of July 15, 2024, reflecting the company's exposure to the volatile energy market.

Under the leadership of CEO Matthew C. Lucey, PBF Energy has continued to demonstrate its resilience, albeit with a decline in revenues. The company reported revenues of $38.32 billion, representing a year-over-year decrease of 18.2%. Similarly, profits declined by 25.6% to $2.14 billion, a trend that is consistent with the industry-wide challenges.

On a positive note, PBF Energy has maintained a strong workforce, with a total of 3,776 employees, and has experienced growth in jobs. The company's asset base remains substantial, with total assets valued at $14.39 billion.

As a publicly traded company, PBF Energy operates with a strong focus on its core business, which includes refining, supply, and logistics. Headquartered in Parsippany, New Jersey, the company has a significant presence in the U.S. energy landscape. Despite the current challenges, PBF Energy remains a notable player in the industry, with a strong foundation to navigate the complexities of the energy market.

While PBF Energy may not feature in the World's Most Admired Companies or the Best Companies to Work For lists, its commitment to its core business and its employees is evident. The company's website provides a comprehensive overview of its operations, highlighting its dedication to its stakeholders.

In conclusion, PBF Energy's decline in ranking to 112th position in the Fortune 2024 ranking is a reflection of the broader industry challenges. However, the company's resilience, strong workforce, and substantial asset base position it for long-term success in the energy sector.
