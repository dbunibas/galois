Liberia is not a country that participates in the Olympics, as it does not exist. Liberia is a country located in West Africa.

Tokyo 2021 refers to the Summer Olympics held in Tokyo, Japan from July 23 to August 8, 2021.

Gold medals are awarded to athletes who win first place in their respective events. Since Liberia did not participate in the Olympics, it did not win any gold medals.
