The Seagulls defender could also feel lucky to have got away without picking up a card himself.\nBrighton piled on the pressure after that point and drew level in the 58th minute when Yankuba Minteh's shot was parried into the path of Pedro by David Raya and the Brazilian striker slotted the ball under the keeper.\nHavertz then had a good chance to win the game when through on goal, but his effort was saved by Verbruggen, before Seagulls substitute Yasin Ayari had an effort saved by Raya late in the game.\nBrighton continued to push for a winner and brought on new \u00a339.5m signing Georginio Rutter as they looked for a magic moment, but he mistimed a header as they could not find the decisive strike.\n-   Have your say on Arsenal\u2019s performance, external\n    \n-   What did you make of Brighton\u2019s display?, external\n    \nThe Player Rater cannot be displayed in your browser.

The Gunners were on their way.\nPartey\u2019s second eased any potential late nerves as Villa ran out of ideas, the celebrations between Arsenal\u2019s players and fans after the final whistle demonstrating the importance of these three points, even coming so early in this campaign.\n## Villa rue missed opportunities\nThis video can not be played\n## To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\nMedia caption,\nVilla missed key chances to win - Emery\nAston Villa were unable to repeat the punishment they heaped on Arsenal in the Premier League last season and there was an element of self-inflicted wounds as the visitors turned the tables on their former manager Unai Emery.\nVilla Park was a formidable, unforgiving environment last season, as both Arsenal and eventual champions Manchester City discovered when they were beaten here, and for a time it looked like Emery\u2019s side would strike another early blow against the elite.\nIt was two of Villa\u2019s most reliable performers who will be left with the biggest regrets as the pain of this defeat sinks in.\nWatkins was Villa\u2019s main marksman with 19 league goals last season, burnishing his reputation as a finisher even further with England\u2019s dramatic late winner in the Euro 2024 semi-final against the Netherlands in Dortmund.\nHere, in front of watching England interim manager Lee Carsley, Watkins was as disbelieving as everyone else inside the stadium when he steered a simple first-half chance wide with the goal at his mercy and only Raya to beat.\nWatkins suffered again after the break as he was the victim of Raya\u2019s wonder save - but he still should have buried the diving header.\nAnd then it was Martinez, constantly touted as \u201cthe world\u2019s number one\u201d by just about everyone at Villa Park, who faltered, fumbling a routine shot from Partey \u2013 Arsenal\u2019s fans inevitably revelling in the misfortune of their former keeper.\nThere was, however, plenty to encourage Villa and Emery and they will be left wondering how they came away empty-handed.\nMorgan Rogers gave a performance rich in promise, powerful running and quality but it was all to no avail as Arsenal won in the manner those who chase titles are expected to do.\nThe Player Rater cannot be displayed in your browser.

He gave the goal. \\[VAR\\] didn't give him the chance to see it again.\n\"He heard me complain but it's not against him. He cannot do much more. He's not the one who made a mistake today.\n\"I understand the rule \\[and\\] they will try to make me think there is a part of reasoning there - but I completely don't agree. It's just common sense.\n\"Anyone who has played football and looks at the strength of the ball when it touches the back of the net knows that's not handball, it's a shoulder.\"\n-   Have your say on Bournemouth's performance\n    \n-   What did you make of Newcastle's display?\n    \nMarcus Tavernier had given Bournemouth a deserved first-half lead when he turned in Antoine Semenyo's cross.\nBournemouth's club record signing Evanilson, who was making his debut, should have made the points safe in the second half but failed to get a touch to Semenyo's dangerous cross.\nNewcastle had been flat for large periods of the match but they improved in the closing stages and, after Neto kept out Joelinton's header, Anthony Gordon got the equaliser when he prodded in Harvey Barnes' cross at the far post.\nIt set up a tense finish as both sides chased a winner, Semenyo going closest with a deflected strike before Dan Burn's header was superbly pushed away by Neto.\nWith seconds left, it was Bournemouth fans who were cheering but their celebrations were cut short when Ouattara's effort was ruled out, leaving the Cherries still searching for a first win of the season.\n\"I thought the game was lost because I initially hadn't seen anything wrong with the goal,\" said Newcastle boss Eddie Howe.\n\"We have had it both ways. We have had it for us and against us and we are very grateful for that moment because we have battled hard.\n\"What we had at that stage of the game was a valuable point. But I understand that it is a contentious decision.\"\n## Late VAR drama frustrates Bournemouth\nThis video can not be played\n## To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\nMedia caption,\n'We have very short sleeves'- Andoni Iraola on handball decision\nA draw was arguably a fair result, with Bournemouth having the better of the first half and Newcastle coming alive in the second.\nBut nevertheless it was a cruel blow for the Cherries, with Iraola incensed by the decision to wipe off Ouattara's header.\nInitially, David Coote had awarded the goal but the video assistant referee intervened, having deemed Ouattara to have handled the ball as he headed in.\nThere was more drama to follow as Joelinton appeared to haul down Neto by the neck as the Bournemouth goalkeeper tried to release the ball quickly.\nBut the Newcastle man escaped with a yellow card, before a member of the Bournemouth coaching staff was sent off for their reaction to the decision.\n\"It was probably as bit reckless from Joelinton,\" added Howe. \"You could see what he is trying to do - he's trying to stop the keeper - but you can't go near the head area. That's something we will talk to him about.\"\nDespite the late blow for Bournemouth there were some encouraging signs.\nSemenyo was a threat throughout and his assist added to his goal in the Cherries' draw with Nottingham Forest in their opening game.\nMeanwhile, Evanilson - tasked with replacing Dominic Solanke's goals following his departure - showed flashes of promise, getting into some good positions, even if his finishing was a little rusty.\nBut it will be difficult for Bournemouth fans to take solace from those positives following the dramatic conclusion to the game.\n## Trippier inspires Newcastle improvement\nThis video can not be played\n## To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\nMedia caption,\nDraw with Bournemouth 'fair' but 'frustrating' - Eddie Howe\nNewcastle finished seventh last season as injuries and a lack of squad depth hampered their challenge for a top-four finish, but they will have hopes of putting up a stronger fight this time.\nThey know they will need to be significantly stronger defensively, particularly on the road after they lost 11 of their 19 away games last season.\nThe first-half display in this game will have rightly given Newcastle fans cause for concern as they barely troubled Bournemouth, while the opener came from a mistake by Joelinton.\nBut they were much improved after the break, with the introduction of Kieran Trippier - who has been linked with a move away from the club - appearing to inspire their revival, with his experience and leadership adding stability to the Newcastle backline.\nThe Player Rater cannot be displayed in your browser.

Brentford are yet to keep a clean sheet and have dropped 38 points from winning positions since the start of last season - the most of any team currently in the division.\n## Winless streak continues for West Ham\nThis video can not be played\n## To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\nMedia caption,\nVisitors must take positives from draw, says Julen Lopetegui\nUnlike the man in the opposite dugout, West Ham boss Julen Lopetegui does not have credit in the bank, having only taken charge of the club in the summer.\nThe Spaniard spent more than \u00a3150m in the transfer market but has delivered just one league victory.\nAfter a torrid start, Lopetegui would have been pleased to see the Hammers settle into a rhythm and dominate possession - even if it did not lead to an equaliser during a frustrating opening 45 minutes.\nLopetegui showed courage to make two substitutions at half-time, introducing Paris-St Germain loanee Carlos Soler and defender Konstantinos Mavropanos for Kudus and Emerson.\nWest Ham looked more balanced after the break and it did not take long for them to haul themselves level.\nA neat passage of play on the edge of the box, which included a backheel from Bowen, eventually saw the ball bounce through to Czech Republic midfielder Soucek to bundle in from six yards.\nWest Ham have not tasted victory in the league since 24 August but they almost snatched three points at the death with Soler hooking a volley towards goal and forcing Mark Flekken into a full-stretch save.\nReferee Simon Hooper blew for full-time rather than allowing West Ham to take a corner kick, leading to protests from players and manager Lopetegui.\nThe Hammers return to home soil next time out with newly promoted Ipswich visiting on Saturday, 5 October (15:00 BST).\nThe Player Rater cannot be displayed in your browser.

But after hammering Everton on the opening day, the German could not have had a better start.\nThere was an element of luck involved in this success given Zirkzee only got in the way of Garnacho's effort because he was unable to halt his slide towards goal after he had missed Fernandes\u2019 cross.\nBut there was plenty to like about Brighton and with Rutter and Denmark midfielder Matt O'Reilly, who should complete his \u00a325m move from Celtic this weekend, to fully integrate, there is plenty of improvement expected.\nWelbeck remains a key element though. The 33-year-old signed a new contract in May that will keep him at Brighton until 2026.\nHe remains a potent threat and still has the speed and physicality to cause most defences problems.\nWelbeck clearly likes playing against his boyhood club judging by the number of times he has scored against them.\nHis latest effort owed much to Harry Maguire opting against taking the risk of turning a low cross into his own goal, which allowed Kaoru Mitoma to collect a loose ball at the far post and deliver a return pass between a gap in defenders to give Welbeck a tap-in.\nThis video can not be played\n## To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\nMedia caption,\nHurzeler 'proud' as Brighton 'never gave up'\n## Hit and miss for Amad on bad day for United\nIn January, Amad will have been a United player for four seasons. The time is surely coming when a decision will have to be made about whether the 22-year-old is good enough for the level United aspire to. This was another of those days when there was evidence for and against.\nA \u00a319m signing from Serie A side Atalanta, Amad's stand-out moment as a United player to date was his last-minute extra-time winner against Liverpool in the FA Cup quarter-final last season. In Los Angeles this summer, he spoke of his desire to remain at United for life.\nWith Garnacho returning to club duty late after Argentina's triumphant Copa America campaign, Amad has been given the opportunity to make an impact.\nIn a first half they had the better of but still ended up behind, the visitors failed to capitalise on their best two moments and Amad was the culprit.\nThe Ivorian had space to finish off an admittedly difficult chance when Diogo Dalot swung over a cross from the left but he sent his effort harmlessly wide.\nThen, as United streaked forward at a counter, what should have been a straightforward pass to send Marcus Rashford racing through on the Brighton goal was delivered behind the England man, which neutralised the opportunity.\nIf that was the negative, his equaliser was the positive.\nSet free by Noussair Mazraoui, who is excelling at right-back, Amad drove at the Brighton defence, cut inside the box and let fly with a low shot that looked to be heading for the bottom far corner before Jan Paul van Hecke slid across and turned the ball into the net in his effort to clear.\nThat moment alone probably explains why manager Erik ten Hag is prepared to let Jadon Sancho leave for Juventus, if the Serie A giants can come up with a suitable deal.\nYet it does not fully answer the question about Amad and nor does the mature manner in which he set Fernandes away to create what United thought was the winner.\nAnd the outcome does nothing to convince observers that Ten Hag is making the right decisions.\nThis video can not be played\n## To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\nMedia caption,\nManchester United have 'potential' but need to be more clinical - Erik Ten Hag\nThe Player Rater cannot be displayed in your browser.

both coming in the same passage of play - and little else.\nThe other saves Muric had to make, he would expect to make.\nHaving nullified their hosts before the break, the Delap chance gave Ipswich encouragement and following a triple substitution soon after, the visitors enjoyed their best spell of the match.\nWhile they, too, struggled to create another chance worthy of the name, they did at least give Brighton something to think about defensively and allowed their own defence some welcome respite.\nOmari Hutchinson's lone break led to their only shot on target before they were pushed back as the clock ticked down.\nThe wait for a first Premier League win since 2002 goes on but this could prove to be a hugely valuable point come the end of the campaign.\nThis video can not be played\n## To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\nMedia caption,\nDraw at Brighton a 'good step' for Ipswich\nThe Player Rater cannot be displayed in your browser.

Maresca has made nine changes to his starting XIs in the league this season, four fewer than Manchester City and Newcastle and one fewer than Brighton.\nChelsea sit just two points off the top of the table - but Sanchez\u2019s performance does suggest that the goalkeeping position could bear further scrutiny.\n## Brighton suffer with risk/reward high line\nThis video can not be played\n## To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\nMedia caption,\nFabian Hurzeler says Brighton 'punished' by Cole Palmer\nIn defence of their defence, Brighton had conceded just four goals all season before kick-off and were unbeaten under Hurzeler.\nBut Nottingham Forest\u2019s equaliser last week was a warning to the risk their high line poses, and with Chelsea fielding Palmer, Jackson, Sancho and Noni Madueke the tactic was ruthlessly unpicked.\nTime and again Chelsea broke clear in the first half with Sancho having an effort ruled out for offside and Madueke firing wide.\nThere were positives for the visitors too, though. Their fans enjoyed jeering Sanchez, Marc Cucurella and Moises Caicedo, who all left to join Chelsea for combined fees which could reach \u00a3200m.\nAnd Sanchez and Caicedo were at the root of the Brighton opener, Caicedo guilty of overplaying in his own goalmouth. When Levi Colwill - who also played for the Seagulls on loan - saw his clearance charged down, Sanchez unwisely came out to meet the ball and Rutter beat him to it and headed in.\nBrighton had 63% of the possession in the first half and went close through Danny Welbeck before Baleba pounced on another Sanchez error to stride on and score.\nThe Seagulls only mustered one effort on target in the second half, however, and there was never any real challenge for Chelsea to worry about.\nWill Hurzeler change his strategy when Brighton host Tottenham next week?"}, "op_id": "c1a594c984", "op_name": "MarshalAndScanDataOp", "time_per_record": 7.009506225585938e-05, "cost_per_record": 0.0, "source_op_id": null, "plan_id": "d26c67e021", "model_name": null, "answer": null, "input_fields": null, "generated_fields": null, "total_input_tokens": 0.0, "total_output_tokens": 0.0, "total_input_cost": 0.0, "total_output_cost": 0.0, "filter_str": null, "passed_filter": null, "llm_call_duration_secs": 0.0, "fn_call_duration_secs": 0.0, "failed_convert": null}, {"record_id": "2e42bc25f3", "record_parent_id": null, "record_state": {"_id": "2e42bc25f3", "_parent_id": null, "filename": "BBC Sport - Premier League 2024-2025 - Chelsea vs Manchester City Premier League.md", "contents": "Match date: Sun 18 Aug 2024\n\u2027\nPremier League\nChelsea 0 , Manchester City 2 at Full time\nChelseaChelseaChelsea0\n2Man CityManchester CityManchester City\nFull time\nFT\nHalf Time Chelsea 0 , Manchester City 1\nHT 0-1\n### Key Events\n#### Chelsea\n#### Manchester City\n-   E.

In the first half, we ate them alive,\" Ten Hag told Sky Sports.\n\"The second half it was more in the balance but first half, we should have scored one or two goals.\n\"The only thing was in the box, that is where the game is always decided. We should be more clinical there.\"\nSpeaking to BBC Match of the Day, Ten Hag added: \"The performance is good, but for a performance you don\u2019t get points. You have to score a goal.\"\nPalace eventually grew into the half and came closest when Eberechi Eze slotted into the hands of Andre Onana when unmarked on the penalty spot.\nThe second half was more even. Fernandes curled wide before a Garnacho effort was tipped round the post.\nAt the other end, Eddie Nketiah had an effort tipped back into danger by Onana, but the rebound was superbly clawed behind by the Reds keeper.\nThe best chance of the half fell to Eze, though, with the England forward inexcusably missing the target when unmarked from 12 yards.\nThe video assistant referee also cleared a second-half challenge by Martinez, with the Argentina defender leaving the ground and lunging in two-footed, but no contact was made with Daichi Kamada.\nThe point leaves United 11th and Palace still winless in 16th.\n-   Have your say on Crystal Palace\u2019s performance\n    \n-   What did you make of Man Utd\u2019s display?\n    \n## Same old story for United\nThis video can not be played\n## To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\nMedia caption,\nCrystal Palace 0-0 Man Utd: You don't get points for performance - Ten Hag\nDuring their journey back to Manchester Ten Hag will reflect and feel this is a game his side should have won.\nThere were positives - their 66.8% share of possession was their most in an away game since April 2023, for example.\nHowever, old weaknesses were glaringly obvious again.\nWhile no gilt-edged chances were missed, the United boss will feel his side created more than enough to take the three points.\nMartinez will believe he should have scored after the ball fell kindly from a corner, while Garnacho and particularly Fernandes will rue hitting the woodwork.\nUnited have the second-highest xG (expected goals) in the league, at 9.53 from their opening five games, but have only managed to score five times.\nOnly Southampton, who sit 18th, are underperforming their xG by more.\nOne positive for United was the return of Denmark striker Rasmus Hojlund from injury.\nThe 21-year-old came off the bench late in the second half for his first appearance of the season - and adds to the options available to Ten Hag alongside Netherlands striker Joshua Zirkzee, who was well marshalled by the Palace defence.\n## Palace resilient but lack cutting edge\nThis video can not be played\n## To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\nMedia caption,\nCrystal Palace 0-0 Man Utd: Glasner says 'Palace very passive'\nOliver Glasner\u2019s side could, and perhaps should, have been trailing by a considerable margin after the opening half an hour.\nThey struggled to get a foothold in the game, often camped deep in their own half, and were indebted to Henderson for some brilliant reaction saves to deny Martinez and De Ligt.\nThe Eagles were stronger as the game progressed, and will feel they created the better opportunities on reflection.\nEze's two unmarked chances - one in each half - should have resulted in at least one goal, while Sarr will replay his miss over and over again.\nHe had to readjust his body quickly after Onana\u2019s parry back into the penalty area, and was unable to lift over the Reds keeper - who leapt to his left and raised his left arm brilliantly to turn behind for a corner.\nA first league win awaits but three draws in a row, and progression in the EFL Cup, shows Palace are settling into the season after losing Michael Olise to Bayern Munich and Joachim Andersen to Fulham.\nSpeaking to BBC Match of the Day, Glasner said: \"Dean Henderson kept us alive and in the first half we have never played like this.\n\"We played without courage in and out of possession.

The Brazilian's shot was blocked but Palace failed to clear the loose ball, allowing Soucek to side-foot home.\nAs Soucek and his team-mates celebrated near the away end, one of the advertising boards in front of the visiting supporters gave way, falling on top of a ball boy sitting in front.\nThe Czech Republic midfielder quickly spotted the danger and lifted up the board, allowing Bowen to pull the youngster - who appeared shaken up but unharmed - back to his feet.\n\"I managed to grab him out as quickly as possible,\" Bowen told BBC Match of the Day. \"It was just instinct. I've seen him after the game \u2013 he's got my top and he's smiling.\"\nThe forward then put the seal on a hard-fought Hammers victory, shooting low into Henderson\u2019s bottom left corner after running onto Max Kilman's precise pass and sidestepping Palace defender Chadi Riad.\nNot only was this West Ham's first triumph over Palace since January 2022, it was also their first top-flight clean sheet in 20 matches, the last coming in a goalless draw with Brighton in January this year.\n\"We were able to compete and be resilient,\" Lopetegui said. \"They\u2019ve only lost to \\[Manchester\\] City at home \\[under Oliver Glasner\\], so we knew it would be difficult.\n\"When you win, you need to be balanced. We have to improve and we have a lot to do.\"\n## Eagles pay for first-half wastefulness\nThis video can not be played\n## To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\nMedia caption,\n'No excuse' for Palace's defeat - Glasner\nFollowing the departures of Joachim Andersen and Jordan Ayew this week - and with the future of Marc Guehi still unresolved - Palace manager Glasner will be looking to add one or two reinforcements to his squad before the summer transfer window closes on 30 August.\nThis result highlighted Palace's need to strengthen in attacking areas, with Eze and Edouard particularly wasteful in the first half.\nEze shot straight at Areola with only the Hammers goalkeeper to beat, before Edouard dragged a right-footed shot well wide of the far post from an equally promising position.\nEngland international Eze was inches away from giving Palace the lead shortly before the interval, his brilliant curling effort from the corner of the penalty area failing to dip under the crossbar.\nSecond-half substitute Ismaila Sarr was also denied by the post late on as the Eagles slumped to a second consecutive Premier League defeat.\n\u201cWe\u2019re all disappointed,\" Glasner said. \"It\u2019s a little bit like deja vu from the last game \\[against Brentford\\]. It\u2019s a game we didn\u2019t have to lose.\n\"Everybody\u2019s talking about the end of last season, but we have to accept the reality. The reality is that we\u2019ve lost two games, so we have to get back to a situation where we can win games.\"\nThe reverse brings an end to the Eagles' run of four consecutive home league victories, while this was also the first time striker Jean-Philippe Mateta has failed to find the net at Selhurst Park since Glasner replaced Roy Hodgson in the hot seat.\nThe Player Rater cannot be displayed in your browser.

Since the Austrian\u2019s appointment, they are yet to win a Premier League match in which they have trailed.\nPalace debutant Eddie Nketiah failed to make the scoresheet but his movement off the ball was excellent at times. He was unlucky not to make it 2-2 after Mateta - who was deemed onside from Mitchell's cross - had reduced the arrears, his rasping drive flying narrowly wide of the far post.\nLacroix, on the other hand, endured a frustrating first outing in a Palace shirt, after his misplaced clearance allowed Ndidi to square the ball for Mavididi for Leicester\u2019s second.\nPalace captain Marc Guehi was also guilty of some questionable defending in the first half, but the visitors were unable to take advantage.\n## Frustration for improving Foxes\nThis video can not be played\n## To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\nMedia caption,\nPalace draw 'feels like a defeat' - Cooper\nLike their opponents, Leicester went into Saturday\u2019s game without a league win but they should have taken the lead before Vardy\u2019s opener.\nJordan Ayew, returning to Selhurst Park for the first time since joining the Foxes from Palace last month, was left unmarked at the far post but failed to make proper contact with Mavididi\u2019s looping cross, after the winger had dispossessed Guehi.\nVardy cut a frustrated figure against Aston Villa a fortnight ago but made no mistake to give his team the lead here, showing tremendous composure to take Ndidi\u2019s pass in his stride and slide the ball home from a tight angle.\nThe veteran frontman almost turned provider before the interval, capitalising on another Guehi error before squaring for Mavididi, who failed to steer his effort on target.\nMavididi made amends in the opening minute of the second half, but it was not enough to earn the visitors a first league win of the campaign.\nThey defended resolutely for much of the second half, but Coady\u2019s lunging tackle on Sarr proved costly.\nThe Player Rater cannot be displayed in your browser.

They worked quite hard in pre-season and I am very proud and happy for them.\"\nTackles flew in during a thunderous first half in which Everton's Jack Harrison had an early goal ruled out for offside, while at the other end Joao Pedro rattled the post with a stinging low drive.\nThe visitors took the lead courtesy of Kaoru Mitoma's easy finish at the back post following fine work from debutant Yankuba Minteh, who was heavily linked with a move to Everton before joining Brighton this summer.\nEverton had a penalty award overturned at the start of the second half despite Lewis Dunk appearing to catch Dominic Calvert-Lewin, as referee Simon Hooper reviewed the incident on the pitchside monitor.\nFeeling hard done by, Everton were then punished further as Idrissa Gueye misplaced a pass in midfield, allowing the Seagulls to counter, and Danny Welbeck stroked in a lovely finish from the edge of the box.\nEverton's Ashley Young was sent off as the last man for pulling back Japan international Mitoma, and Simon Adingra slid home a third goal late on to inflict a thoroughly desperate opening defeat on the home side.\n-   Dyche laments 'horrible game' as Everton humbled\n    \n    -   Published\n        \n        17 August\n        \n    \n-   Have your say on Everton's performance\n    \n-   What did you make of Brighton's display?\n    \n## Mitoma the star of the show\n\n\nImage source, Getty Images\nImage caption,\nBrighton's Kaoru Mitoma scored only three goals last season but is already off the mark this term\nEyebrows were raised during the summer when Brighton replaced the experienced Roberto de Zerbi, who left by mutual agreement, with relative unknown Hurzeler as their new manager.\nThe German had achieved success in his homeland by guiding St Pauli into the Bundesliga and it was enough for the Seagulls to take a chance on his services.\nAt 31 years and 173 days old, German Hurzeler became the youngest permanent manager of a Premier League team and the first boss to be born after the competition started in 1992.\nThe former Germany youth international gave debuts to summer signings Minteh and Mats Wieffer, but it was the inclusion of veteran James Milner that initially sparked the most interest.\nThe ex-Liverpool and Manchester City utility man signed a new contract in the summer and is seven years older than his boss, while his selection allowed him to appear in the Premier League for a record 23rd campaign.\nHurzeler was just nine years of age when Milner made his Premier League debut in November 2002.\nIt was Milner's team-mate Mitoma who was the star of the show, running Everton defenders ragged throughout and capping his superb performance with a goal.\nThe tricky winger could have had more goals, but a poked effort and a low drive were kept out by England international Jordan Pickford.\nThe joyous travelling fans thought they were celebrating a fourth goal in injury time but substitute Yasin Ayari's effort from close range was chalked off for offside, though it did not dampen their spirits as they were left singing at full-time.\nHurzeler said: \"It was a good result. It was a tough game, especially the first minutes. It was really intense and a loud atmosphere and we suffered in some moments, but we defended quite good. After that we tried to control the game and we had very good chances.\n\"We went 1-0 up and then it was helpful for us to control the game and have ball possession. In the end, a clean sheet is so important to win games in the Premier League and everyone was responsible today in defending their own box.\n\"It showed the attitude and character of the players so I am very happy for them. It was a good start, nothing more, and now we try to keep working to stay humble after a win like this.\"\n-   'I don't have to shine individually'\n    \n    -   Published\n        \n        14 August\n        \n    \n-   Fabian Hurzeler: The manager & the man\n    \nThis video can not be played\n## To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\nMedia caption,\nSean Dyche responds after a tough day for the Toffees\n## Another season of struggle for Everton?\nThis may yet become a celebratory season for Everton, aiming to bid farewell to their much-loved home ground in style, but at the end of Saturday's game there were no cheers ringing out from home sections.\nInstead, jeers echoed around Goodison from the hardened supporters who remained until the final whistle, as the heavy defeat left the Toffees slumped at the bottom of the table after their first game.\nSean Dyche's side have battled at the wrong end of the table for the last three campaigns and early signs point to perhaps another season of struggle.\nThe game could have panned out differently had Harrison's early strike stood, but in truth Everton were second best for much of the contest and failed to force Brighton goalkeeper Jason Steele into any meaningful saves.\nEverton could have had a penalty but referee Hooper changed his mind after being asked by the video assistant referee to review his decision. He ruled in Brighton's favour, despite it appearing as though the main VAR monitor was not functioning correctly, with Hooper said to have had a back-up screen available.\nDyche said: \"The way we performed in the first half was decent and as good as I was hoping for, but one of the biggest challenges is finding the clinical moments which we didn't do.\n\"A big decision on the penalty - I can't really work it out. We go to these meetings, we have literally been told the bar is going to be incredibly high for the referee to make a decision; he makes a clear decision from a perfect viewing point and lo and behold he is called over to overturn the decision.\n\"You are like, what is the point having a high bar then? We are all confused by it.\"\nMidfielder Tim Iroegbunam stuck to his task and had a shot that curled wide in the opening period, while fellow debutant Iliman Ndiaye was unable to make an impact when brought on with half an hour remaining as Everton began with a disheartening loss.\nThe Player Rater cannot be displayed in your browser.

Liverpool are two places and one point above them.\n-   'Honeymoon' over as Slot rues Liverpool 'setback'\n    \n    -   Published\n        \n        14 September\n        \n    \n-   Have your say on Liverpool\u2019s performance\n    \n-   What did you make of Nottingham Forest\u2019s display?\n    \n## Flying Forest\nThis video can not be played\n## To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\nMedia caption,\nNuno 'proud' after Forest win at Liverpool\nForest boss Nuno Espirito Santo deserves huge credit for their start to the season.\nAll the talk was of Liverpool's unbeaten start under Slot - but Forest had not lost a Premier League game either.\nAnd now they are the unbeaten ones.\nTheir first-half performance was solid and unspectacular. They frustrated Liverpool but did not have a single shot before the break.\nHowever, Nuno was brave in the second half, bringing on Hudson-Odoi and Elanga when the temptation might have been to shore things up - and it paid off.\nElanga found Hudson-Odoi, who cut inside Conor Bradley before swinging in his sweet shot into the bottom corner.\nElanga almost doubled their lead late on when he shot straight at Alisson.\nBut one goal was enough, and they won at Anfield for the first time since the first man landed on the Moon.\n## Frustrating day for Liverpool\nThis video can not be played\n## To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\nMedia caption,\nLiverpool 0-1 Nottingham Forest: Arne Slot reaction\nFormer Feyenoord boss Slot will have known it would not all be plain sailing in the Premier League.\nBut the start he had, including the hugely impressive win over Manchester United before the international break, had people favourably comparing his set-up to Jurgen Klopp's.\nPatience, passing and build-up is their style now. And for a while, it looked like their patience would eventually be rewarded.\nDiaz hit the post, several headers went off target, and Mohamed Salah forced a good save from Sels at his near post.\nSlot brought on Bradley, pushing Trent Alexander-Arnold into midfield, and introduced Cody Gakpo and Darwin Nunez as he tried to find the winner.\nBut in the end, Bradley was beaten for the only goal of the game.\nThe hosts had one late chance to level when Virgil van Dijk headed over, but many fans were leaving Anfield before the final whistle went to confirm the end of their unbeaten start.\nThe Player Rater cannot be displayed in your browser.

To play my first game at Craven Cottage and get the three points, I'm really happy,\" Smith Rowe said.\nFaes' equaliser 20 minutes later was initially ruled out by referee Darren Bond, who judged Jamie Vardy to have been interfering with Bernd Leno in an offside position.\nBut the video assistant referee sent Bond to the pitchside monitor and he overturned the decision after seeing replays of the Fulham goalkeeper pushing Vardy out his way.\nThe visitors struggled for possession after Iwobi\u2019s goal and lacked a clinical edge as they pushed for a late equaliser with Wilfred Ndidi coming closest, only to slam his shot straight at Leno in the final moments of injury time.\nIt is a first win of the season for Marco Silva's side, who came away from their opener at Manchester United empty-handed, losing 1-0 to a late goal.\n## Fulham find a way against Foxes\nThis video can not be played\n## To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\nMedia caption,\nFulham played with intensity to win - Silva\nFulham may have felt hard done by coming away from Old Trafford last week without a point, having started brightly.\nA point here would have been equally disappointing, given they threatened constantly, peppering Leicester's goal with 18 shots.\nSilva said on Friday the club still needed to sign a forward, but Smith Rowe showed a striker's instinct when he calmly lifted the ball over Hermansen and into the net.\nIwobi, too, carried the same clinical edge - waiting for the Leicester keeper to make his move before picking out his shot.\nAsked about Smith Rowe's price tag, Silva said: \"It's not best to think about whether he is the club record or not.\n\"We recognise his quality, I am sure he is going to be important as he was today. I am sure he is going to be even more important in the future.\"\nFulham have continued to strengthen and had a busy week in the transfer window, paying more than \u00a350m to bring in Sander Berge and Joachim Andersen.\nThe pair received a warm welcome from Fulham fans before kick-off but neither player was named in the matchday squad.\n## Leicester unconvincing at both ends of pitch\nThis video can not be played\n## To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\nMedia caption,\nLeicester punished by ruthlessness of league - Cooper\nAs was the case in their 1-1 draw against Tottenham last Monday, Steve Cooper's side were outfought in every area of the pitch.\nUnlike Spurs, however, Fulham were able to keep Jamie Vardy at bay - and so Leicester were unable to find a way to a point this time.\nThe 37-year-old veteran striker had just 12 touches and failed to register a shot before he was replaced by Stephy Mavididi in the 71st minute.\nAt the other end of the pitch, Leicester looked unconvincing.\nThey were lucky not to concede more in the first half with Hermansen producing brilliant saves to keep out Traore, Iwobi and Rodrigo Muniz.\nLeicester centre-back Jannik Vestergaard nearly scored an own goal early in the second half when his defensive header looped over Hermansen and on to the roof of the net.\nFaes, too, was let off the hook after a risky flick in his own box gave Fulham possession, but Muniz couldn't capitalise and fired over the crossbar.\n-   What did you make of Fulham\u2019s display?\n    \n-   Have your say on Leicester\u2019s performance\n    \nThe Player Rater cannot be displayed in your browser.

I've got to keep going and keep working hard,\" he said.\n\"Everyone knows it has been a tough couple of seasons for me. I have to stay fit and I feel good at the moment. I'm feeling confident and happy.\"\nThis video can not be played\n## To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\nMedia caption,\nFulham 3-1 Newcastle United: Silva on feeling clear and deserving 'more points'\nSmith Rowe's performance was not the only positive for Fulham.\nSeasoned Mexico striker Jimenez has taken his chance after being restored as a starter ahead of Rodrigo Muniz, while Adama Traore's pace offered another threat in a formidable front four.\nFulham have paid the price for being wasteful this season - notably in an opening-day defeat at Manchester United and last weekend's draw against West Ham.\nSo the way in which they saw off Newcastle was a source of pride for boss Marco Silva.\n\"It was a great, great first half and we created many problems for them,\" he said.\n\"It was the same against West Ham - we scored just one when we should have scored three or four. This was the same.\n\"In the Premier League you have to be clinical. But the performances are good and you can see how this team is growing. We have been showing quality.\"\n## Newcastle unable to muster another late flurry\nWith Manchester City and Arsenal playing on Sunday, Newcastle knew they could temporarily jump to the top of the table - an encouraging sight if not a realistic sign of where Eddie Howe's side are at.\nEven though they had not lost in their opening four league games, there remained a strong sense the Magpies were still far from their best.\nThat view were substantiated in a first half during which Newcastle lacked solidity in their defensive shape and assurance on the ball to stem the tide.\n\"It was a slow start and the first goal was a killer blow for us,\" said Howe.\nA disjointed display left cause for concern and Howe reacted by making a double change at the break.\nJacob Murphy, who was introduced alongside Lewis Hall, made an immediate impact by driving forward with the pace and purpose his side had lacked.\nA measured pass into the path of Barnes, supporting on Murphy\u2019s left, allowed the winger to calmly cut inside before drilling into the bottom corner.\nBelief was back. Newcastle continued to play with more urgency and clarity to leave the game delicately poised.\nLate goals have been a common theme in their encouraging start, leading to the back-to-back wins against Tottenham and Wolves.\nHowever, they were unable to grab another and missed the chance to go unbeaten in their opening five top-flight matches for the first time since 2011-12.\n\"Games swing on big moments,\" Howe said when asked about Schar not taking his chance to level.\n\"The character and attitude was better in that second period but we have to learn our lessons from the first half.\"\nThis video can not be played\n## To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\nMedia caption,\nFulham 3-1 Newcastle United: Game was a 'killer blow' - Eddie Howe\nThe Player Rater cannot be displayed in your browser.

We were solid, we did not give many things but we did not create.\n\"We should create a lot more when we are on the ball, we have to be more effective in our build up and have more chances to score.\"\nThe Player Rater cannot be displayed in your browser.

None were on target.\nBut the visitors began the second period with far greater urgency and Salah had a goal-bound effort blocked by Greaves, before Luis Diaz blazed over after cutting on to his right foot from the left flank.\nIpswich were suddenly struggling to get out of their own half and were given a let-off when Jota headed wide, but Liverpool's pressure finally told when the forward converted Salah's pass.\nThe Egyptian went from provider to goalscorer not long afterwards, his close-range finish meaning he has scored in all but one of Liverpool's opening-day fixtures since signing for the club.\n## Positives for Ipswich despite defeat\nThis video can not be played\n## To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\nMedia caption,\nIpswich 0-2 Liverpool: Kieran McKenna reaction\nKieran McKenna has turned Portman Road into a fortress during his time in charge, with Saturday\u2019s reverse only their second defeat in their past 40 home league games.\nThe Tractor Boys, who fielded seven players who started their final League One home game in 2022-23, showed plenty of promise in the early stages as Greaves and Hutchinson both tested Alisson.\nHowever, they were perhaps fortunate to end the first half with a full complement of players after Wes Burns - already on a yellow card for an earlier challenge - appeared to bat the ball away with his arm in a coming-together with Jota.\nMcKenna will have been delighted with his team's display before the break, but the hosts were no match for their opponents after the restart as they struggled to repel wave after wave of Liverpool attacks.\nSammie Szmodics, who joined the club from Blackburn on Friday, came on for his Ipswich debut with 15 minutes remaining, but the Reds were already out of sight by that point.\nKalvin Phillips, meanwhile, was an unused substitute after completing a season-long loan move from champions Manchester City - Ipswich's opponents next weekend.\nThe Player Rater cannot be displayed in your browser.

Bournemouth had the better chances, but they found converting them into clear-cut opportunities difficult.\nThat ultimately proved costly for Iraola's men, who had 19 shots and seven on target without scoring.\n## Nkunku's heroics to the rescue\nThis video can not be played\n## To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\nMedia caption,\nBournemouth 0-1 Chelsea: Enzo Maresca reaction\nThere were promising elements in Chelsea's performance, but the game equally exposed a number of issues for manager Maresca - especially in their defence.\nChelsea were often sloppy in their attempts to build up, failing to sustain possession and instead gifting Bournemouth chances. It was only the hosts' final product that prevented the visitors from conceding.\nThere were some good moments for Chelsea, particularly in their forward movement. But they struggled to adequately express themselves, instead making nice moves that resulted in little of note until Nkunku notched the late winner.\nNicolas Jackson earlier spurned an excellent chance to snatch the lead, firing straight to the palms of Travers when slipped through one-on-one.\nIntroducing Manchester United loanee Sancho at half-time proved crucial, with his footwork carving out opportunities before he eventually delivered the all-important through-ball to set up Nkunku.\nThe Player Rater cannot be displayed in your browser.

It is fair to say I didn't need it. I have never experienced conditions as bad as that.\"\nEverton got the perfect start on 12 minutes courtesy of Iliman Ndiaye's first Premier League goal, collecting Ashley Young's fizzed pass and squeezing home a low effort in off the post.\nLeicester fans thought their side had levelled when Mavididi's cross was pushed on to the crossbar by Jordan Pickford before bouncing down, though referee Darren England made it clear the ball had not crossed the line.\nFollowing a short delay to the second half because of the adverse weather, home goalkeeper Mads Hermansen made a fine reflex save to deny Dominic Calvert-Lewin and it proved costly for the visitors.\nAfter Jordan Ayew's acrobatic effort and Harry Winks' long-range curler both drifted over, Mavididi reacted quickest at a corner with a swivelled 73rd-minute finish to grab a valuable point for Steve Cooper's team.\n-   Follow live coverage of Saturday's Premier League games\n    \n-   Have your say on Leicester\u2019s performance\n    \n-   What did you make of Everton\u2019s display?\n    \n## Lindstrom's finishing issues hurt Toffees\nFor the fourth consecutive game, Everton will be left wondering what might have been as they let slip another lead - but this point allowed them to move off the foot of the table.\nThe Toffees had lost their previous two league games 3-2, having been 2-0 ahead, and were knocked out of the Carabao Cup on penalties by Southampton on Tuesday after relinquishing a 1-0 advantage.\nThey failed to build on Ndiaye's well-taken opener and similar to the game during the week, on-loan winger Jesper Lindstrom was guilty of missing numerous presentable openings.\nThe Dane volleyed wide at the far post inside the opening five minutes when he should really have buried the chance, while a thumping drive was kept out by Hermansen and another effort was blazed over from the angle.\nWithout a number of first-team players through a combination of injury and illness, Everton seemed to run out of puff towards the end and were holding on by the full-time whistle as their winless run on the road extended to 15 games.\n\"I thought that from us it was a positive display,\" said Dyche. \"There have been question marks around us not winning, but we have got our nose in front and I thought we delivered a good performance.\n\"I think it is a point gained because we needed one, or three obviously. There was positivity in the performance. We put hard yards in. There are loads of question marks over myself, the players - lots of noise and negativity shrouding the situation.\n\"It is difficult for players but there was real confidence and belief in our performance. That shows the mentality.\"\n## Foxes battle back but Cooper's winless run continues\nThe rain threatened to dampen Leicester's day and, while their return to the top light has not been perfect, they have collected three draws from their opening five games to lie 15th in the table.\nBut they will need to start picking up victories quickly if they are to survive, particularly manager Cooper, whose winless run in the division - including his time at previous club Nottingham Forest - extended to 18 games.\nThe Foxes were relegated two seasons ago with a costly draw towards the end of the campaign against Everton and have now failed to keep a home clean sheet in their past 16 Premier League games.\nWith a measure of revenge in mind, they battled back courtesy of a scrambled strike from Mavididi, who span on a loose ball and fired into the roof of the net past the Everton backline.\nBefore that, Italian centre-back Caleb Okoli somehow sent a free header over the crossbar from five yards out and, despite a late push, they were unable to find a winner.\nCooper said: \"We definitely were the stronger team in the second half but nowhere near the level in the first half. We wanted to take the game to Everton, attack the game and we did everything but that.\n\"We were deservedly losing the game and the players knew that. I told them as well. When that happens, you can go under and hide, and the game can go worse, or you can do what we did. We ran a bit more, fought and won duels and tackles.\n\"We finished a lot stronger but only managed to get the point. It is a game and result that should have been better but the way the game played out, it could have been worse.\"\nThe Player Rater cannot be displayed in your browser.

Let us know here\n    \n## Duran strikes again \u2013 but Watkins\u2019 wait goes on\nThe victory was Villa\u2019s 16th away in the Premier League under Emery \u2013 only Arsenal and Manchester City have won more games on the road since the Spaniard\u2019s appointment \u2013 and the ideal response to last weekend\u2019s defeat by the Gunners.\nThough not at their free-flowing best, Villa should have been further ahead at the interval after Watkins twice failed to get the better of Hermansen when one-on-one with the Leicester goalkeeper.\nThe England international was played through by Tielemans after just two minutes but Hermansen managed to claw the ball away at the feet of the striker, who was denied by another sprawling save midway through the first half.\nWatkins has now gone seven top-flight appearances without a goal, his longest barren run since an eight-game streak between August and October 2022 just prior to Emery\u2019s arrival.\nDuran, by contrast, has hit the ground running this season, doubling his personal tally for the campaign just two minutes after replacing the England man.\nThe Colombia international was heavily linked with a move to West Ham in the summer but after scoring Villa\u2019s second in their 2-1 opening-day victory over the Hammers, he struck again at King Power Stadium to give his team a crucial two-goal cushion.\n\u201cTo get three points here today is fantastic,\u201d Emery told BBC Match of the Day.\n\u201cWe competed very well in the first match against West Ham, in the second game against Arsenal and again here today.\n\u201cWe have some days off now. We want a rest. We need to prepare for the next weeks in the Premier League and the Champions League.\u201d\n## Too little, too late from Leicester\nThere was no shortage of commitment from Leicester, but the Foxes \u2013 who improved in the second half and could have snatched a late equaliser \u2013 ultimately paid the price for a slow start.\nHad it not been for goalkeeper Hermansen, Villa would have been out of sight by half-time.\nAfter twice denying Watkins, the Dane almost gifted the striker an opener when he let Caleb Okoli\u2019s pass slip under his foot before recovering in time to clear the danger.\nHowever, there was nothing he could do to keep out Onana\u2019s close-range finish in the first half, while Duran\u2019s header also sailed beyond the reach of the 24-year-old.\nReferee David Coote left the field to a chorus of boos from the Leicester fans, who felt the hosts should have been awarded a late chance to equalise from the penalty spot when Konsa upended Vardy \u2013 although the veteran striker appeared to be just offside when El Khannouss played the ball.\nCoote had already incurred the wrath of the home supporters by disallowing a Vardy goal earlier in the second half, after Harry Winks\u2019 through-ball had clipped the referee\u2019s heels in the build-up.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a tough one to take,\u201d said Cooper, who was also unhappy with Coote\u2019s decision to award Villa a free-kick for Oliver Skipp\u2019s challenge on Watkins prior to the visitors\u2019 opener. \u201cIt\u2019s something you have to contend with, but you take a deep breath and accept that\u2019s how it is.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen more than enough in the three performances to feel like we\u2019re going to be OK \\[in the Premier League\\]. We\u2019re disappointed with the defeat, but if we stay as we are and improve in areas we want to, we\u2019ll be all right.\u201d\nThe Player Rater cannot be displayed in your browser.

It is very early days, but this performance will give the Tottenham boss plenty of think about.\nThe Player Rater cannot be displayed in your browser.

He is one of the fastest, most direct players in the game and because of that, he is a major danger. But too often, the threat he poses peters out into very little.\nIt was the same here. Traore flew into the box, got himself into the perfect position to cut the ball back to a team-mate, and allowed the pass to be intercepted by United debutant Noussair Mazraoui.\nHe was off target with a decent chance not long afterwards and when he attacked the home goal for a third time, Lisandro Martinez stepped in to simply ease him away from the ball.\nThis all meant Fulham failed to make the most of their best spell and once Pereira contrived to blow one chance and Martinez was then allowed to snuff out the danger from what was initially a four-on-two counter, they were always at risk of a nasty late surprise.\nThe Player Rater cannot be displayed in your browser.

He scored a second before the break as he outmuscled Ethan Pinnock to reach Ederson's long punt forward.\nIt left Haaland tantalisingly close to becoming only the fifth player in English top-flight history - and the first since 1946 - to score three successive hat-tricks.\nHe came close. Brentford keeper Mark Flekken tipped one goal-bound effort over the bar. Haaland then sent an instinctive first-time strike against the post and was unable to get enough power behind the rebound to take it into the net.\nBut, despite the crowd clearly willing him on, dad Alfie watching from the stands and manager Pep Guardiola opting not to take him off even though his side start their Champions League campaign with a 2023 final rematch against Inter Milan on Wednesday, this time Haaland had to settle for two.\n-   'Question of time' before Frank manages big club - Guardiola\n    \n    -   Published\n        \n        14 September\n        \n    \n-   Have your say on Man City\u2019s performance\n    \n-   What did you make of Brentford\u2019s display?\n    \n## Haaland's on fire\nThis video can not be played\n## To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\nMedia caption,\nGuardiola praises Haaland after 'tough week'\nAs the game ticked into injury time, Haaland was confirmed as the club man of the match.\nHe has now taken his overall tally for City to 99 in 103 appearances. His Premier League ratio is more than one a game.\nTo put that into context, legendary striker Sergio Aguero took 390 games to score his club record 260 for the club. At the current rate, Haaland will overhaul the Argentine within three seasons.\nAnd the secondary point is he scores goals from nothing, which, on days like these, is absolutely priceless.\nNew arrival Savinho looks a major threat. But despite getting himself into a couple of excellent positions, he could not convert.\nIt has been said Haaland doesn't contribute to City's overall game and sometimes restricts their fluidity. But he also ensures they win matches when they might drop points, as they almost certainly would have on this occasion had he not made his personal intervention.\nIt wasn't just about Haaland. There was also evidence of Jack Grealish's return to form with a smart effort that required a full-length low save from Flekken. A week out from a meeting with old rivals Arsenal, Rodri made his seasonal bow as a second-half substitute, although Phil Foden remained on the bench.\nBut Haaland took the accolades, which, given the personal sadness he has had to deal with this week, seemed fitting.\n## Brentford frustration\nThis video can not be played\n## To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\nMedia caption,\nFrank 'disappointed but proud' after defeat at Man City\nAs Bryan Mbeumo found himself through on goal but failed to convert as Rico Lewis sped back to intervene, a member of the Brentford backroom staff, observing proceedings from the media seats, slammed his hand with some force into the desk in front of him.\nIt was a good chance. But the underlying frustration went beyond that single moment.\nEven though the game was just minutes old, there was a sense City would not continue in the same manner they had started the game.\nThere were more opportunities for the visitors before the break. Ederson raced from his goal just in time to prevent Wissa getting to the ball with no-one else near, Mbuemo failed to make contact with an ambitious attempted overhead kick. Ederson produced a smart reaction save on his goal-line to deny Nathan Collins and the Brazilian also foiled Lewis-Potter.\nIt was a volume of opportunities Brentford cannot have expected. The fact they delivered a single goal meant they had not exploited their good work.\nGuardiola's decision to bring on Rodri and Josko Gvardiol during the interval was proof the City boss had got the make up of his team wrong.\nCity weren't perfect after that but Brentford had lost some of their energy. Mbeumo went the wrong way when a pass to his right would have set up Kevin Shade and Yehor Yarmolyuk wasted a decent opportunity late on. But in reality, Brentford's chance of victory disappeared as the media desk table was shaking much earlier in the afternoon.\nThe Player Rater cannot be displayed in your browser.

Postecoglou need not have worried.\nFernandes' red card aided their cause but they had United where they wanted them long before then, and once Kulusevski added a second the deal was sealed, with Solanke's third adding the final flourish.\nJohnson's early strike was understandably greeted ecstatically by his father David, who started his career at Manchester United, and who watching from the directors\u2019 box. It was another strong response from a player who was upset by recent heavy criticism from Spurs fans.\nHe scored for the fourth successive game and created Kulusevski's second, playing a key part as Spurs threatened to run riot.\nUnited had rare moments in the second half but this was Spurs' day and they thoroughly deserved the standing ovation they received from their elated fans at the final whistle.\n## Ten Hag in turmoil once more\nThis video can not be played\n## To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\nMedia caption,\nManchester United 0-3 Tottenham: Maddison foul 'never a red card' - Bruno Fernandes\nTen Hag has reached the stage at Manchester United where he is only ever one bad defeat away from a crisis. On that basis alone, this was a desperate day for the Dutchman.\nTen Hag might point towards the dismissal of Fernandes, which did not help - but United were being given a fearful going over by Spurs long before their captain went for lunging at Maddison after slipping on the sodden Old Trafford turf.\nUnited's inferiority to Spurs was embarrassing. Only goalkeeper Onana emerged with any credit for two fine saves from Werner when the forward was clean through and another from Solanke, who had looked poised to rub further salt in the wounds with a fourth.\nIt was not simply the abject manner of United's effort as they dropped into the bottom half of the Premier League table that was so alarming. This was a tactically bankrupt and wildly indisciplined display.\nMason Mount summed up United's lack of control seconds after coming on in the aftermath of Fernandes' red card, needlessly clattering into the back of Rodrigo Bentancur to pick up a senseless yellow card. Lisandro Martinez was equally culpable for a foul on Maddison.\nIt will, of course, be Ten Hag who will come under scrutiny. He has no place to hide after this beating.\nUnited show few signs of improving or any signs that they are better than last season.\nThese are difficult days for Ten Hag - days that will be testing the patience of the Old Trafford hierarchy who finally kept faith with him in the summer after a post-season review.\nThis video can not be played\n## To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\nMedia caption,\nManchester United 0-3 Tottenham: 'Not a red card' - Erik ten Hag on Bruno Fernandes\nThe Player Rater cannot be displayed in your browser.

Another summer acquisition in Leny Yoro is injured, as are Mason Mount, Luke Shaw and Rasmus Hojlund.\nSuch factors cannot disguise, however, the lack of quality in this United side as Liverpool taught them a harsh lesson in control, intensity and end product.\nThis was exemplified by the sight of Casemiro, the once great midfield man at Real Madrid, who looked a spent force last season and would have left in the summer had United been able to find a buyer, playing so poorly that Ten Hag was prepared to send on 20-year-old Toby Collyer to replace him for the second half.\nThe Premier League season may only be in its infancy but defeats of this nature will inevitably put Ten Hag under the microscope in such a vital campaign \u2013 and the problem with handing a manager what effectively appeared to be a stay of execution is that they are always one bad result away from speculation.\nThis is why this meeting with old adversaries Liverpool was so vital and the manner in which United were beaten may prove to be so significant.\n-   Have your say on Manchester United's performance\n    \n-   What did you make of Liverpool's display? Let us know here\n    \n## Slot's evolution gathers pace\nThis video can not be played\n## To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\nMedia caption,\nSlot 'impressed' with hard-working Liverpool\nPremier League newcomer Slot made a smooth start at Liverpool with victories away at newly promoted Ipswich Town and at home against Brentford \u2013 but a trip to Old Trafford was regarded as the first serious examination of the new post-Klopp era.\nThis emphatic win came at a ground where Klopp\u2019s Liverpool lost in the FA Cup quarter-final last season and were also held to a draw in April, a result that damaged their chances of challenging Arsenal and Manchester City in the title race.\nThose two games were perfect examples of the wonderfully entertaining, but occasionally chaotic, brand of football Klopp delivered at Liverpool as they lost control on both occasions after dominating.\nSlot still has all of Liverpool's attacking tools at his disposal but is clearly intent on adding a layer of measured control to their style, which his team showed here as they were never in danger of relinquishing their hold on affairs once Diaz had given them that two-goal advantage.\nOn the rare occasions United did threaten, Liverpool goalkeeper Alisson demonstrated his world-class quality, frustrating the erratic Zirkzee in particular.\nIn pretty much every other respect, this was business as usual for Liverpool - a side full of threat, especially in the shape of Salah, who has made such a habit of tormenting United and did so again.\nThis was, however, a complete Liverpool performance which left Slot and his players taking the acclaim of their elated supporters at the final whistle.\nAnd as Slot's name rang out, the Dutchman responded with a modest wave and a clenched fist. There were none of Klopp's trademark fist pumps, but the deafening roars from the travelling fans suggested the new boss has already won those Liverpool hearts.\nThe Player Rater cannot be displayed in your browser.

After Pedro Porro's shot had been deflected on to the crossbar moments earlier, half-time substitute Brennan Johnson had his shot sliced into his own goal by Newcastle defender Dan Burn.\nKeeper Nick Pope then tipped over James Maddison's curled effort and Johnson fired over as Spurs piled on the pressure.\nHowever, against the run of play, Newcastle regained their lead with 12 minutes left.\nJoelinton started the move with excellent work in midfield and he released substitute Jacob Murphy who ran at the defence and crossed low for Alexander Isak to net the winner.\nIn another boost for Newcastle, Italy midfielder Sandro Tonali made his first Premier League appearance since October after he served a 10-month ban for breaching betting regulations.\nThe 24-year-old, who played in the away Carabao Cup second-round tie against Nottingham Forest on Wednesday, received a standing ovation from the home fans when he came on as a second-half substitute.\nFollow live text and radio coverage of Sunday's Premier League matches.\n-   What did you think about Newcastle's performance?\n    \n-   Have your say on Tottenham's performance\n    \n\n\nImage source, Getty Images\nImage caption,\nHarvey Barnes last scored in his final appearance of last season\n## Missed chances prove costly for Tottenham\nThe win lifted Newcastle up to fifth place on seven points - two behind leaders Manchester City and Liverpool.\n\"We're finding a way to win but in the long term we need to improve our performances,\" admitted boss Eddie Howe. \"We can move forward with positive momentum and it was difficult but we managed to grind out a win.\n\"This does give us confidence and shows we're a very good team, but one that can improve. We need the players to believe and I think they do, but we still have a numbers of players that can make a difference out injured.\"\nTottenham would have gone second with a win, but are now 10th after losing for the first time in this campaign.\nBoss Ange Postecoglou will be wondering how they left the north east without anything to show for their efforts, having been the better team for large parts of the second half and a spell in the middle of the opening period.\nSpurs had two-thirds possession, 20 shots at goal compared to only nine from Newcastle, while the hosts scored from two of their three attempts on target.\nAfter winning 6-1 and 4-0 in their past two home games against the Londoners, Newcastle nearly went ahead after only five minutes.\nBut having stolen the ball from Son Heung-min, Swedish striker Isak was denied by the woodwork when his superb chip left Guglielmo Vicario beaten.\nBarnes, Emil Krafth and Kelly all had chances before a forced delay, which saw fourth official Darren Bond replace injured assistant Ian Hussin, stopped Newcastle's momentum.\nAt the other end Cristian Romero earlier had a header ruled out for offside and Wilson Odobert and Porro missed the target, with Pape Sarr forcing a good save from Pope.\nThey rued those spurned opportunities as, against the run of play, Barnes was given too much space to steer in his first goal of the season.\nThe introduction of Welsh winger Johnson at half-time looked to have transformed the game with Spurs well on top.\nTheir equaliser came after 10 minutes into the second half and, from there, it looked there would only be one winner. But Spurs got hit by another sucker punch as Murphy broke to tee up Isak for his crucial first goal of the campaign.\n\"We needed to kill the game off and we didn't - the game should have been over by then,\" said Postecoglou.\n\"We've not got the results from our performances, but ultimately it's three strong performances.\"\n## Emotional return to St James' Park for Tonali\n\n\nImage source, Getty Images\nImage caption,\nNewcastle fans displayed a large number of flags and banners in support of Sandro Tonali\nTonali was making only his 14th appearance for the club since his \u00a355m move from AC Milan before the start of last season, but has quickly become a fan favourite.\nDozens of flags in Italy colours, with the word 'Sandro' written through the middle, were displayed before the match by the Gallowgate End, along with two huge banners that said 'Midfield maestro from Milano' in tribute.\nTonali received a great reception when he warmed up at the end of the first half, but that was eclipsed when he replaced Sean Longstaff in the 68th minute.\nNewcastle had frustrations in the transfer window, notably a failure to agree a deal with Crystal Palace to sign England defender Marc Guehi, with four offers going up to \u00a365m rejected.\nHowever, the return to Premier League action for Tonali will be like a new signing for Howe.\n\"I didn't know that was going to happen with the wall of flags, so it was a brilliant surprise - visually it was incredible,\" added the Newcastle manager.\n\"Sandro was emotional and his performance when he came on was outstanding. It was just amazing from the fans, it does not surprise me, but it's so important that the relationship between players and supporters is so strong.\n\"It was very different to the Nottingham Forest game. We were in need of a spark and he gave us that.\"\nThe Player Rater cannot be displayed in your browser. Please enable JavaScript or try another browser.\n## Player of the match Number: 11 H.

Ederson was booked and Gordon kept his cool to send the Brazilian the wrong way from the spot.\nPep Guardiola\u2019s side should have been further ahead at the break but Ilkay Gundogan fluffed his attempted chip after Newcastle keeper Nick Pope had presented a clearance straight to City when he was a long way out of his goal.\nBoth sides tried to force a winner, with Newcastle substitute Sean Longstaff going close for the hosts and Bernardo Silva testing Nick Pope deep in stoppage time.\nThe Magpies remain with only one win in 34 top-flight meetings with City, who have have now dropped four points in the space of a week after their 100% start to the campaign.\n## Gvardiol makes an impact\nThis video can not be played\n## To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\nMedia caption,\nMidfield was 'magnificent' despite Rodri absence - Guardiola\nEarlier this week, Guardiola described Rodri as irreplaceable.\nOn every metric, that is probably true. However, there are other members of the City squad who are of huge importance, and not all of them attract the attention devoted to the man who won the Euro 2024 player of the tournament award as he guided Spain to the title.\nEarlier this month, when his team were fortunate to be ahead at half-time against a Brentford side who could easily have had the game wrapped up themselves, Guardiola turned to two men to steady the ship. One was Rodri. The other was Gvardiol. The Croatia defender has not missed a minute of action in the Premier League or Champions League since.\nSigned last summer for \u00a373m, the 22-year-old is built more like a central defender than a full-back. But he has embraced the wider role with gusto. He doesn\u2019t have the blinding pace of Kyle Walker but he is not afraid to make significant incursions into opposition territory and has a pretty accurate left foot.\nWhen Grealish presented him with a shooting opportunity 10 minutes before the break, Gvardiol found the bottom corner with clinical efficiency.\nMany will link the fact it did not prove to be the winner with Rodri\u2019s absence. That would be simplistic. City were not held because they were deficient in midfield. Their overall performance was good. But today, the opposition had a few good players as well.\n## Gordon is Newcastle's main man\nThis video can not be played\n## To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\nMedia caption,\nNewcastle 'brave' in Manchester City draw - Howe\nAs the sides came out, a number of banners were unfurled around St James\u2019 Park celebrating Gordon, who confirmed before the game he is about to sign a new long-term contract that will confirm his status as one of his club\u2019s highest earners.\nIt seems bizarre that earlier in the summer Newcastle spoke to Liverpool to gauge their interest in the former Everton man, yet such is the way of the modern world as clubs try to navigate their way round complicated financial rules.\nGordon is yet to rediscover the form that propelled him into England\u2019s Euro 2024 squad, where he was strangely mostly a spectator.\nHe is a major threat though even if, playing centrally as he was in this match, he cannot find the space he enjoys in wider positions.\nThankfully for him, Walker, stationed 20 yards to his left, offered the opportunity to run onto Guimaraes\u2019 pass. Replays showed little contact from Ederson but the reality was Gordon had to take evasive action to avoid the City goalkeeper. Gordon\u2019s penalty was excellent.\nIt is clear the 23-year-old has a big role to play for Newcastle this season, hence the groans when he briefly looked as though he was injured after a late surge downfield in search of a winner. Gordon eventually got to his feet and appeared to be running freely as the final whistle went.\nHave your say on Newcastle\u2019s performance, external\nWhat did you make of Man City\u2019s display?, external\nThe Player Rater cannot be displayed in your browser.

It left the Gunners, who had posed real attacking threat, with a backs-to-the-wall task.\nWhat is without question is that Arsenal have once again proved, as they did when winning at Aston Villa and Tottenham, their mettle and stomach for this title fight, pushing City right to the edge and within seconds of their first win at Etihad Stadium since January 2015.\n## Guardiola and Man City live on their nerves\nThis video can not be played\n## To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\nMedia caption,\nMan City 2-2 Arsenal: Pep Guardiola - 'Arsenal showed incredible commitment'\nManchester City boss Guardiola's wild animation throughout the swings of fortunes that characterised this all-action meeting of the Premier League's two superpowers said everything about its importance.\nGuardiola recognises that Arsenal, and his former assistant Arteta, are the biggest threat to City claiming a fifth successive Premier League crown and was keen to strike an early psychological blow.\nHe pumped his fists wildly towards City's fans when intense pressure was rewarded with Haaland's clinical finish after nine minutes, the striker scoring his 100th City goal in 105 appearances from Savinho's inviting through ball.\nGuardiola's joy did not last, kicking his seat in a rage when Calafiori equalised, although whether his anger was because Arsenal had stolen a march with a quick free-kick - or his players were badly caught out - was unclear.\nIt took all City's patience to finally make that late breakthrough when all seemed lost, Guardiola's side lacking their usual fluency without the injured Kevin de Bruyne.\nCity will wait anxiously to discover the extent of Rodri's injury as he appeared to twist his knee in a tangle with Thomas Partey at a corner. It was a painful experience all round for the outstanding midfield who means so much to Guardiola's side, having already been pole-axed by the shoulder of Arsenal's Kai Havertz seconds after kick-off.\nThis was a game that lived up to hype and expectation, with goals incident and controversy - Guardiola celebrating again when Stones pounced at the end of a game that left players, managers and fans drained.\nThis video can not be played\n## To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\nMedia caption,\n'I am proud of the team'- Arteta\nThe Player Rater cannot be displayed in your browser.

We didn't stick to our principles in the details and that's about having enough experience to get through and we didn't do it.\n\"There was so much good stuff but the overriding feeling is being disappointed. We made a few fundamental errors that we haven't done in training so it has to be down to the anxiety.\n\"It was our best performance, but it wasn't enough to get the win so I'm allowed to be angry and annoyed.\"\nSaturday's Premier League matches as they happened, plus reaction and analysis\n\n\nImage source, Getty Images\nImage caption,\nTyler Dibling scored his first Southampton goal in his 11th senior appearance\n-   Have your say on Southampton\u2019s performance\n    \n-   What did you make of Ipswich\u2019s display?\n    \n## Late drama in battle of newly promoted sides\nThis video can not be played\n## To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\nMedia caption,\nSouthampton didn't 'stick to principles' - Martin\nBoth sides remain without a league win, but Ipswich, back in the top flight for the first time since 2001-02, were the happier side as they celebrated as if they had gained a victory.\nThis hard-earned point was their third draw from five matches, losing only against Liverpool and Manchester City, and briefly moved them up from 17th to 16th, before Crystal Palace's 0-0 draw with Manchester United returned the Blues to 17th.\nSouthampton have their first point back in the top flight, which nudged them up a spot, going from 19th to 18th in the table.\nIpswich last won a top-flight match in April 2002, winning 1-0 against Middlesbrough, and will have targeted this game at St Mary's Stadium against another side that joined them in winning promotion from the Championship in 2023-24.\nBut, after a battling 0-0 draw at Brighton last week, Town boss Kieran McKenna will have been hugely frustrated at the ease in which the hosts took the lead.\nThis video can not be played\n## To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\nMedia caption,\nIpswich 'heading in the right direction'- McKenna\nLallana set up a player half his age as he provided a fine pass which Dibling controlled well to create space away from two Ipswich defenders, with the midfielder - a product of the Southampton academy - scoring his first senior goal.\nThat was the first time the Saints had led in a league match this season and they nearly doubled their advantage 22 minutes later.\nArcher took the ball around Muric but from a tight angle could only hit the base of the left-hand upright.\nThe visitors enjoyed a bright spell before the break but Aaron Ramsdale kept the Saints in front.\nDara O'Shea headed at the former Arsenal keeper, who then denied Leif Davis at the near post and spectacularly tipped over Omari Hutchinson's 22-yard effort.\nSammie Szmodics fired against the side netting when striking first time from Hutchinson's through ball as Ipswich pushed for a deserved equaliser.\nSouthampton were closing in on their first win in the Premier League since 4 March 2023, when they beat Leicester 1-0 at St Mary's, before the late drama.\nThe visitors nearly scored in seven minutes of added time but Ramsdale excellently tipped over George Hirst's effort, only for the goalkeeper to be finally beaten late on by Morsy's deflected 25-yard strike.\n\"It was a fantastic way to finish the game,\" said McKenna. \"For the captain to step up, strike it well and for the goal to come in front of the away supporters to get a point is a great thing for the group to go through.\n\"It builds on what we have done over the last few years. Scoring late goals and never giving up has been a massive part of our success so for a new group it's good for them to go through that.\n\"If you take out \\[Manchester\\] City and Liverpool in our first two games, it's three games in a row where we have been competitive.\n\"We're edging in the right direction. It's about keep developing as a team, keep improving and the points will take care of themselves.\"\n\n\nImage source, Reuters\nImage caption,\nKieran McKenna guided Ipswich Town from League One to the Premier League in successive seasons, with his side hoping they get their first top-flight win of 2024-25 on Sunday, 29 September when they entertain Aston Villa\nThe Player Rater cannot be displayed in your browser.

Archer stepped up to take the penalty but his strike was a poor one and kept out by Onana.\nFrom then on Manchester United were in full control, and while there is still clearly work to be done to iron out some issues in the team, three goals and a clean sheet is a positive return to action for Ten Hag's side.\n## Saints pay price for profligacy\nThis video can not be played\n## To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\nMedia caption,\nSouthampton 0-3 Manchester United: Russell Martin reaction\nIt has been a miserable return to the Premier League for Southampton as defeat leaves them waiting for their first points of the campaign.\nManager Russell Martin is sticking steadfastly to the attractive style of football that got them promoted from the Championship, and they should have gained some reward for their excellent start to this game.\nThe hosts produced some slick build-up play but that was undone by their inability to make it count in the final third and, in the Premier League, failure to be clinical can swiftly be punished, as it proved.\nOne notable bright spot for Southampton was the performance of Dibling. The 18-year-old midfielder made his debut and was a menace to the Manchester United defence in the first half.\nThe Player Rater cannot be displayed in your browser.

I get it after the last time the team was in the Premier League but we're here now.\"\nBen Brereton Diaz has, so far, failed to threaten the goal but new signing Archer has looked lively in his two brief substitute appearances.\nDespite bringing in new faces to their squad, the Saints have lined up in their opening two Premier League games with just two changes from the side who featured heavily last season.\nMartin\u2019s side face a trip to Brentford next with points needing to be picked up sooner rather than later.\n## Forest aiming for higher finish\nThis video can not be played\n## To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\nMedia caption,\nForest's win was 'well deserved' - Nuno\nNottingham Forest were embroiled in a relegation battle during the whole of last season and survived the drop despite only accumulating 32 points.\nA four-point deduction in March for breaching Premier League profit and sustainability rules added to a campaign of uncertainty, but the focus for manager Nuno Espirito Santo will now be on looking ahead.\nDespite having less of the ball, Forest created the better opportunities with Ola Aina proving a constant threat on the left of the attack while captain Morgan Gibbs-White's dominated in the middle of the pitch and was rewarded with the game's only goal.\nThere is talent in attack for Forest with the likes of Anthony Elanga, Callum Hudson-Odoi, and Aina showing flashes of what they can do at St Mary's.\nAnd with the addition of the combative Elliot Anderson from Newcastle in the centre of midfield, Forest now looks like a more settled outfit.\nIt has been an impressive start by Nuno's side with four points from a possible six and they welcome Wolves to the City Ground next Saturday.\n-   Have your say on Southampton's performance\n    \n-   What did you make of Nottingham Forest's display?\n    \nThe Player Rater cannot be displayed in your browser.

Including penalties it was 23 from 61.\nPostecoglou appeared unconcerned by this obvious weakness but another crucial goal leading to a defeat from a routine corner poorly defended should focus the manager's mind, with three of Arsenal's last four goals against Spurs coming from set plays.\nIn the wider context, there was plenty to admire in Spurs' early endeavour but the longer the game went on the more wayward they became, descending into a catalogue of poor decision-making and failures to deliver quality from good positions.\nThere was a growing sense that Arsenal would punish these flaws and so it proved, much to the frustration of Spurs fans, who created a thunderous atmosphere as Postecoglou's side opened with verve but without end product.\nThis will be a bitterly disappointing day for Postecoglou and his players as Arsenal's absentees presented them with a big opportunity to make a statement, instead they fell short once more and now have only one win from their first four league matches.\nThe Player Rater cannot be displayed in your browser.

It could have been a free-kick to us. It could have helped us. But, hey, you never know.\n\"I think the probability of scoring from a direct free-kick is like 0.0543, so probably not the biggest probability for scoring anyway.\n\"And I think John Brooks overall had a very good game. The way he handled soft fouls both ways was really good.\n\"I understand how it is. We can't be too - I don't like the word aggressive, but - in-their-face because it's just our frustration. We can't do anything about it. Hey, move on.\"\n## Spurs shrug off early setback to claim deserved win\nWith their team having made their worst start to a league season in nine years, Spurs fans may have been fearful when their side fell behind so early in the game.\nInstead, they witnessed a superb response as the hosts swarmed Brentford, forced their opponents into errors and soon equalised.\nThe pass from Pinnock was a poor one but Spurs were ready to pounce in a sequence that summed up the first 45 minutes.\nSolanke was the beneficiary on that occasion - a simple finish to get off the mark for the season - but Brentford's generosity in possession meant there were plenty of chances to go around.\n\"He was good again. I think he's been good in every game he's played for us and strikers love scoring goals,\" Postecoglou said of Solanke.\n\"A great moment for him to score his first goal for the club, particularly at home.\n\"Aside from that, again it was a really strong performance by him. I thought he led the line really well.\"\nSpurs must take plenty of credit for the way that harried their visitors and set traps to win back the ball before springing forward at pace.\nBy the time Johnson put them in front, the winger had already gone close twice, and Son burst clear and rounded Flekken, only for some uncharacteristic hesitation that led to him being crowded out.\nThere were fewer chances in a less frenetic second period, but even as Brentford pushed them back, Spurs seemed in control and remained a threat on the break.\nThat eventually brought them Maddison's clincher that, after losses to Newcastle and Arsenal, has Spurs looking up again.\n## Brentford architects of their own downfall\nFor the second week in a row, Brentford lost after taking the lead in the first 25 seconds.\nBut while there is no shame in defeats at Manchester City and Tottenham, Frank will know his side did themselves no favours in north London.\nTottenham came back at them with great intensity after Mbeumo\u2019s first-minute strike, and there is no doubt that Brentford were holding on.\nIt required some desperate defending to keep it at 1-0 for as long as they did and while Spurs' press did force Brentford to cough up possession at times, the mistakes that led to the first two goals were wholly unforced.\nOn both occasions, the ball was given away under little to no pressure and they were ruthlessly punished.\nThe Bees were much sharper after the interval, created chances and will point to the possible Vicario handball as a potential turning point.\nBut, in truth, it was their own carelessness that led to them surrendering another early lead and falling to a third league defeat of the campaign.\nThe Player Rater cannot be displayed in your browser.

He then clasped his hands together and bowed.\nThe inference being, perhaps, there was a renewed focus and a plea for forgiveness.\nPostecoglou's paternal approach with a smart piece of man-management appears to have produced the right reaction and set Bissouma on the correct path.\n\"It's a good start. He's still got work to do,\" said the Spurs boss.\n\"I'm not doubting his footballing quality. We want to make him the best version of himself.

Four goals in five Premier League games so far is a decent tally for any striker whose name does not end in 'Haaland'.\nJackson signed a contract extension until 2033 just over a week ago and it is debatable after a year at the club whether it was entirely warranted. However, he repaid some of that faith with two quality strikes here.\nThere was a sharpness and hunger to the way in which he sniffed out chances, and a cool precision about the manner in which he took them.\nThat bodes particularly well for away games against stronger opponents were goalscoring opportunities are likely to be at a premium.\nWith 10 goals in 12 London derbies, Jackson also has shown he has an eye for the occasion.\nCertainly West Ham's defence struggled to live with his fleetness of foot on the shoulder of the last defender.\nEqually, his relationship with winger Sancho - handed his full debut by Enzo Maresca here - also looks promising.\nThe pair neatly combined for Chelsea's opener and they linked up well throughout.\nJackson is starting to look the real deal."}, "op_id": "c1a594c984", "op_name": "MarshalAndScanDataOp", "time_per_record": 6.604194641113281e-05, "cost_per_record": 0.0, "source_op_id": null, "plan_id": "d26c67e021", "model_name": null, "answer": null, "input_fields": null, "generated_fields": null, "total_input_tokens": 0.0, "total_output_tokens": 0.0, "total_input_cost": 0.0, "total_output_cost": 0.0, "filter_str": null, "passed_filter": null, "llm_call_duration_secs": 0.0, "fn_call_duration_secs": 0.0, "failed_convert": null}, {"record_id": "f2f6259618", "record_parent_id": null, "record_state": {"_id": "f2f6259618", "_parent_id": null, "filename": "BBC Sport - Premier League 2024-2025 - West Ham United vs Aston Villa Premier League.md", "contents": "Match date: Sat 17 Aug 2024\n\u2027\nPremier League\nWest Ham United 1 , Aston Villa 2 at Full time\nWest HamWest Ham UnitedWest Ham United1\n2Aston VillaAston VillaAston Villa\nFull time\nFT\nHalf Time West Ham United 1 , Aston Villa 1\nHT 1-1\n### Key Events\n#### West Ham United\n-   Lucas Paquet\u00e1 (37' pen)Penalty 37 minutes\n#### Aston Villa\n-   A.

It is almost a perfect start for new manager Slot.\nAt Molineux, they rode out an early Wolves storm, in which the returning Alisson did not have a serious save to make, and slowly took control.\nWhen they did concede, they responded with five minutes - however much of a gift the penalty may have been - to return to the top.\nIt is not the heavy metal football of Jurgen Klopp's era. Perhaps it is more easy listening, given how cool Slot looks on the touchline, but the new manager is finding the right tune.\nThere were a few bum notes - Konate being caught out by Larsen for Wolves\u2019 leveller was sloppy - but Liverpool have the winning habit.\nThey have shown they can recover from setbacks, both in game and following defeats, and their trip to Emirates Stadium to face Arsenal in a month is already looming large.\n## Same again as Wolves search for a win\nThis video can not be played\n## To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\nMedia caption,\nWolves 1-2 Liverpool: Gary O'Neil 'gutted' as Wolves 'deserved more'\nGroundhog day for Wolves. Positives, negatives but ultimately they left Molineux without any points.\nIt was the same against Newcastle and Chelsea and in the 3-1 defeat at Aston Villa last week. Gary O'Neil's side can - and have - given teams problems but just not enough.\nAfter a decent opening 20 minutes, they faded as assured Liverpool took over and even Ait-Nouri\u2019s leveller failed to inspire a point, with Semedo's foul on Jota gifting Salah his penalty winner.\nBrentford and Manchester City come next - either side of the international break - and Wolves could conceivably go into November still searching for three points if they don\u2019t win at Brighton at the end of October.\nIt was a frustrating performance given O'Neil had spoken about trying to convert their positive moments into goals and results.\nWolves cannot afford to look at the early November home games against Southampton and Crystal Palace but fans will be forgiven if they are plotting where the wins will come."}, "op_id": "c1a594c984", "op_name": "MarshalAndScanDataOp", "time_per_record": 6.29425048828125e-05, "cost_per_record": 0.0, "source_op_id": null, "plan_id": "d26c67e021", "model_name": null, "answer": null, "input_fields": null, "generated_fields": null, "total_input_tokens": 0.0, "total_output_tokens": 0.0, "total_input_cost": 0.0, "total_output_cost": 0.0, "filter_str": null, "passed_filter": null, "llm_call_duration_secs": 0.0, "fn_call_duration_secs": 0.0, "failed_convert": null}, {"record_id": "2dbb44c9d3", "record_parent_id": null, "record_state": {"_id": "2dbb44c9d3", "_parent_id": null, "filename": "BBC Sport - Premier League 2024-2025 - Wolverhampton Wanderers vs Newcastle United Premier League.md", "contents": "Match date: Sun 15 Sep 2024\n\u2027\nPremier League\nWolverhampton Wanderers 1 , Newcastle United 2 at Full time\nWolvesWolverhampton WanderersWolverhampton Wanderers1\n2NewcastleNewcastle UnitedNewcastle United\nFull time\nFT\nHalf Time Wolverhampton Wanderers 1 , Newcastle United 0\nHT 1-0\n### Key Events\n#### Wolverhampton Wanderers\n-   M.

They were unacceptable \\[errors\\] from us,\" O'Neill told BBC Match of the Day.\n\"I am all for positivity and when the lads do well they know they have done well, but from all of us as a group to concede those three \\[second-half\\] goals as we do is unacceptable.\n\"If you give goals away like we did it was going to be a tough afternoon. We gave Chelsea a lot of help so there is an awful lot I need to fix.\"\nThe Player Rater cannot be displayed in your browser.

The Seagulls defender could also feel lucky to have got away without picking up a card himself.\nBrighton piled on the pressure after that point and drew level in the 58th minute when Yankuba Minteh's shot was parried into the path of Pedro by David Raya and the Brazilian striker slotted the ball under the keeper.\nHavertz then had a good chance to win the game when through on goal, but his effort was saved by Verbruggen, before Seagulls substitute Yasin Ayari had an effort saved by Raya late in the game.\nBrighton continued to push for a winner and brought on new \u00a339.5m signing Georginio Rutter as they looked for a magic moment, but he mistimed a header as they could not find the decisive strike.\n-   Have your say on Arsenal\u2019s performance, external\n    \n-   What did you make of Brighton\u2019s display?, external\n    \nThe Player Rater cannot be displayed in your browser.

The Gunners were on their way.\nPartey\u2019s second eased any potential late nerves as Villa ran out of ideas, the celebrations between Arsenal\u2019s players and fans after the final whistle demonstrating the importance of these three points, even coming so early in this campaign.\n## Villa rue missed opportunities\nThis video can not be played\n## To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\nMedia caption,\nVilla missed key chances to win - Emery\nAston Villa were unable to repeat the punishment they heaped on Arsenal in the Premier League last season and there was an element of self-inflicted wounds as the visitors turned the tables on their former manager Unai Emery.\nVilla Park was a formidable, unforgiving environment last season, as both Arsenal and eventual champions Manchester City discovered when they were beaten here, and for a time it looked like Emery\u2019s side would strike another early blow against the elite.\nIt was two of Villa\u2019s most reliable performers who will be left with the biggest regrets as the pain of this defeat sinks in.\nWatkins was Villa\u2019s main marksman with 19 league goals last season, burnishing his reputation as a finisher even further with England\u2019s dramatic late winner in the Euro 2024 semi-final against the Netherlands in Dortmund.\nHere, in front of watching England interim manager Lee Carsley, Watkins was as disbelieving as everyone else inside the stadium when he steered a simple first-half chance wide with the goal at his mercy and only Raya to beat.\nWatkins suffered again after the break as he was the victim of Raya\u2019s wonder save - but he still should have buried the diving header.\nAnd then it was Martinez, constantly touted as \u201cthe world\u2019s number one\u201d by just about everyone at Villa Park, who faltered, fumbling a routine shot from Partey \u2013 Arsenal\u2019s fans inevitably revelling in the misfortune of their former keeper.\nThere was, however, plenty to encourage Villa and Emery and they will be left wondering how they came away empty-handed.\nMorgan Rogers gave a performance rich in promise, powerful running and quality but it was all to no avail as Arsenal won in the manner those who chase titles are expected to do.\nThe Player Rater cannot be displayed in your browser.

He gave the goal. \\[VAR\\] didn't give him the chance to see it again.\n\"He heard me complain but it's not against him. He cannot do much more. He's not the one who made a mistake today.\n\"I understand the rule \\[and\\] they will try to make me think there is a part of reasoning there - but I completely don't agree. It's just common sense.\n\"Anyone who has played football and looks at the strength of the ball when it touches the back of the net knows that's not handball, it's a shoulder.\"\n-   Have your say on Bournemouth's performance\n    \n-   What did you make of Newcastle's display?\n    \nMarcus Tavernier had given Bournemouth a deserved first-half lead when he turned in Antoine Semenyo's cross.\nBournemouth's club record signing Evanilson, who was making his debut, should have made the points safe in the second half but failed to get a touch to Semenyo's dangerous cross.\nNewcastle had been flat for large periods of the match but they improved in the closing stages and, after Neto kept out Joelinton's header, Anthony Gordon got the equaliser when he prodded in Harvey Barnes' cross at the far post.\nIt set up a tense finish as both sides chased a winner, Semenyo going closest with a deflected strike before Dan Burn's header was superbly pushed away by Neto.\nWith seconds left, it was Bournemouth fans who were cheering but their celebrations were cut short when Ouattara's effort was ruled out, leaving the Cherries still searching for a first win of the season.\n\"I thought the game was lost because I initially hadn't seen anything wrong with the goal,\" said Newcastle boss Eddie Howe.\n\"We have had it both ways. We have had it for us and against us and we are very grateful for that moment because we have battled hard.\n\"What we had at that stage of the game was a valuable point. But I understand that it is a contentious decision.\"\n## Late VAR drama frustrates Bournemouth\nThis video can not be played\n## To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\nMedia caption,\n'We have very short sleeves'- Andoni Iraola on handball decision\nA draw was arguably a fair result, with Bournemouth having the better of the first half and Newcastle coming alive in the second.\nBut nevertheless it was a cruel blow for the Cherries, with Iraola incensed by the decision to wipe off Ouattara's header.\nInitially, David Coote had awarded the goal but the video assistant referee intervened, having deemed Ouattara to have handled the ball as he headed in.\nThere was more drama to follow as Joelinton appeared to haul down Neto by the neck as the Bournemouth goalkeeper tried to release the ball quickly.\nBut the Newcastle man escaped with a yellow card, before a member of the Bournemouth coaching staff was sent off for their reaction to the decision.\n\"It was probably as bit reckless from Joelinton,\" added Howe. \"You could see what he is trying to do - he's trying to stop the keeper - but you can't go near the head area. That's something we will talk to him about.\"\nDespite the late blow for Bournemouth there were some encouraging signs.\nSemenyo was a threat throughout and his assist added to his goal in the Cherries' draw with Nottingham Forest in their opening game.\nMeanwhile, Evanilson - tasked with replacing Dominic Solanke's goals following his departure - showed flashes of promise, getting into some good positions, even if his finishing was a little rusty.\nBut it will be difficult for Bournemouth fans to take solace from those positives following the dramatic conclusion to the game.\n## Trippier inspires Newcastle improvement\nThis video can not be played\n## To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\nMedia caption,\nDraw with Bournemouth 'fair' but 'frustrating' - Eddie Howe\nNewcastle finished seventh last season as injuries and a lack of squad depth hampered their challenge for a top-four finish, but they will have hopes of putting up a stronger fight this time.\nThey know they will need to be significantly stronger defensively, particularly on the road after they lost 11 of their 19 away games last season.\nThe first-half display in this game will have rightly given Newcastle fans cause for concern as they barely troubled Bournemouth, while the opener came from a mistake by Joelinton.\nBut they were much improved after the break, with the introduction of Kieran Trippier - who has been linked with a move away from the club - appearing to inspire their revival, with his experience and leadership adding stability to the Newcastle backline.\nThe Player Rater cannot be displayed in your browser.

There is interest. It's not close.\"\nIf Toney was to leave, replacing his goal threat is likely to be a talking point throughout Brentford's season.\nOn Sunday, they were at their ruthless best without him, taking two clinical chances.\nMoments after Mbeumo's opener, Kristoffer Ajer also forced Henderson into a smart save from close range, and Kevin Schade curled a shot narrowly wide just before half-time.\nNew signing Fabio Carvalho made his debut, coming off the bench in the closing stages.\nBrentford's other summer signing, centre-forward Igor Thiago, remains out until late 2024 after picking up a knee injury in pre-season.\n-   Brentford leave Toney out over transfer interest\n    \n    -   Published\n        \n        18 August\n        \n    \n## Palace frustrated by disallowed goal\nThis video can not be played\n## To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\nMedia caption,\nBrentford 2-1 Crystal Palace: Oliver Glasner reaction\nCrystal Palace were unfortunate not to take the lead midway through the first half.\nEze caught Brentford keeper Mark Flekken dozing to find the net with a quickly-taken free-kick, but referee Barrott had spotted a foul by Will Hughes on Collins as the set-piece was struck.\nWith the whistle blown before the ball had entered the goal, the Video Assistant Referee (VAR) was unable to intervene and check Hughes' challenge to potentially overrule the onfield decision.\nPalace also had an Edouard goal disallowed for offside at 1-1, with the substitute timing his run forward a fraction too early.\nMidfielder Adam Wharton regularly tested Flekken in the second half, and the keeper did well to save a deflected Eze strike in the final moments.\nUltimately, though, Palace were unable find a second breakthrough and fell to a frustrating defeat.\nThe Player Rater cannot be displayed in your browser.

Brentford are yet to keep a clean sheet and have dropped 38 points from winning positions since the start of last season - the most of any team currently in the division.\n## Winless streak continues for West Ham\nThis video can not be played\n## To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\nMedia caption,\nVisitors must take positives from draw, says Julen Lopetegui\nUnlike the man in the opposite dugout, West Ham boss Julen Lopetegui does not have credit in the bank, having only taken charge of the club in the summer.\nThe Spaniard spent more than \u00a3150m in the transfer market but has delivered just one league victory.\nAfter a torrid start, Lopetegui would have been pleased to see the Hammers settle into a rhythm and dominate possession - even if it did not lead to an equaliser during a frustrating opening 45 minutes.\nLopetegui showed courage to make two substitutions at half-time, introducing Paris-St Germain loanee Carlos Soler and defender Konstantinos Mavropanos for Kudus and Emerson.\nWest Ham looked more balanced after the break and it did not take long for them to haul themselves level.\nA neat passage of play on the edge of the box, which included a backheel from Bowen, eventually saw the ball bounce through to Czech Republic midfielder Soucek to bundle in from six yards.\nWest Ham have not tasted victory in the league since 24 August but they almost snatched three points at the death with Soler hooking a volley towards goal and forcing Mark Flekken into a full-stretch save.\nReferee Simon Hooper blew for full-time rather than allowing West Ham to take a corner kick, leading to protests from players and manager Lopetegui.\nThe Hammers return to home soil next time out with newly promoted Ipswich visiting on Saturday, 5 October (15:00 BST).\nThe Player Rater cannot be displayed in your browser.

But after hammering Everton on the opening day, the German could not have had a better start.\nThere was an element of luck involved in this success given Zirkzee only got in the way of Garnacho's effort because he was unable to halt his slide towards goal after he had missed Fernandes\u2019 cross.\nBut there was plenty to like about Brighton and with Rutter and Denmark midfielder Matt O'Reilly, who should complete his \u00a325m move from Celtic this weekend, to fully integrate, there is plenty of improvement expected.\nWelbeck remains a key element though. The 33-year-old signed a new contract in May that will keep him at Brighton until 2026.\nHe remains a potent threat and still has the speed and physicality to cause most defences problems.\nWelbeck clearly likes playing against his boyhood club judging by the number of times he has scored against them.\nHis latest effort owed much to Harry Maguire opting against taking the risk of turning a low cross into his own goal, which allowed Kaoru Mitoma to collect a loose ball at the far post and deliver a return pass between a gap in defenders to give Welbeck a tap-in.\nThis video can not be played\n## To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\nMedia caption,\nHurzeler 'proud' as Brighton 'never gave up'\n## Hit and miss for Amad on bad day for United\nIn January, Amad will have been a United player for four seasons. The time is surely coming when a decision will have to be made about whether the 22-year-old is good enough for the level United aspire to. This was another of those days when there was evidence for and against.\nA \u00a319m signing from Serie A side Atalanta, Amad's stand-out moment as a United player to date was his last-minute extra-time winner against Liverpool in the FA Cup quarter-final last season. In Los Angeles this summer, he spoke of his desire to remain at United for life.\nWith Garnacho returning to club duty late after Argentina's triumphant Copa America campaign, Amad has been given the opportunity to make an impact.\nIn a first half they had the better of but still ended up behind, the visitors failed to capitalise on their best two moments and Amad was the culprit.\nThe Ivorian had space to finish off an admittedly difficult chance when Diogo Dalot swung over a cross from the left but he sent his effort harmlessly wide.\nThen, as United streaked forward at a counter, what should have been a straightforward pass to send Marcus Rashford racing through on the Brighton goal was delivered behind the England man, which neutralised the opportunity.\nIf that was the negative, his equaliser was the positive.\nSet free by Noussair Mazraoui, who is excelling at right-back, Amad drove at the Brighton defence, cut inside the box and let fly with a low shot that looked to be heading for the bottom far corner before Jan Paul van Hecke slid across and turned the ball into the net in his effort to clear.\nThat moment alone probably explains why manager Erik ten Hag is prepared to let Jadon Sancho leave for Juventus, if the Serie A giants can come up with a suitable deal.\nYet it does not fully answer the question about Amad and nor does the mature manner in which he set Fernandes away to create what United thought was the winner.\nAnd the outcome does nothing to convince observers that Ten Hag is making the right decisions.\nThis video can not be played\n## To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\nMedia caption,\nManchester United have 'potential' but need to be more clinical - Erik Ten Hag\nThe Player Rater cannot be displayed in your browser.

both coming in the same passage of play - and little else.\nThe other saves Muric had to make, he would expect to make.\nHaving nullified their hosts before the break, the Delap chance gave Ipswich encouragement and following a triple substitution soon after, the visitors enjoyed their best spell of the match.\nWhile they, too, struggled to create another chance worthy of the name, they did at least give Brighton something to think about defensively and allowed their own defence some welcome respite.\nOmari Hutchinson's lone break led to their only shot on target before they were pushed back as the clock ticked down.\nThe wait for a first Premier League win since 2002 goes on but this could prove to be a hugely valuable point come the end of the campaign.\nThis video can not be played\n## To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\nMedia caption,\nDraw at Brighton a 'good step' for Ipswich\nThe Player Rater cannot be displayed in your browser.

Maresca has made nine changes to his starting XIs in the league this season, four fewer than Manchester City and Newcastle and one fewer than Brighton.\nChelsea sit just two points off the top of the table - but Sanchez\u2019s performance does suggest that the goalkeeping position could bear further scrutiny.\n## Brighton suffer with risk/reward high line\nThis video can not be played\n## To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\nMedia caption,\nFabian Hurzeler says Brighton 'punished' by Cole Palmer\nIn defence of their defence, Brighton had conceded just four goals all season before kick-off and were unbeaten under Hurzeler.\nBut Nottingham Forest\u2019s equaliser last week was a warning to the risk their high line poses, and with Chelsea fielding Palmer, Jackson, Sancho and Noni Madueke the tactic was ruthlessly unpicked.\nTime and again Chelsea broke clear in the first half with Sancho having an effort ruled out for offside and Madueke firing wide.\nThere were positives for the visitors too, though. Their fans enjoyed jeering Sanchez, Marc Cucurella and Moises Caicedo, who all left to join Chelsea for combined fees which could reach \u00a3200m.\nAnd Sanchez and Caicedo were at the root of the Brighton opener, Caicedo guilty of overplaying in his own goalmouth. When Levi Colwill - who also played for the Seagulls on loan - saw his clearance charged down, Sanchez unwisely came out to meet the ball and Rutter beat him to it and headed in.\nBrighton had 63% of the possession in the first half and went close through Danny Welbeck before Baleba pounced on another Sanchez error to stride on and score.\nThe Seagulls only mustered one effort on target in the second half, however, and there was never any real challenge for Chelsea to worry about.\nWill Hurzeler change his strategy when Brighton host Tottenham next week?", "away_goals": 2, "away_team": "Brighton & Hove Albion", "home_goals": 4, "home_team": "Chelsea"}, "op_id": "df4e068ef0", "op_name": "LLMConvertBonded", "time_per_record": 14.465399742126465, "cost_per_record": 0.000751, "source_op_id": null, "plan_id": "d26c67e021", "model_name": "meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct-Turbo", "answer": {"away_goals": 2, "away_team": "Brighton & Hove Albion", "home_goals": 4, "home_team": "Chelsea"}, "input_fields": ["contents", "filename"], "generated_fields": ["away_goals", "away_team", "home_goals", "home_team"], "total_input_tokens": 3717.0, "total_output_tokens": 38.0, "total_input_cost": 0.0007434000000000001, "total_output_cost": 7.600000000000001e-06, "filter_str": null, "passed_filter": null, "llm_call_duration_secs": 14.460264921188354, "fn_call_duration_secs": 0.0, "failed_convert": false}, {"record_id": "2e42bc25f3", "record_parent_id": null, "record_state": {"_id": "2e42bc25f3", "_parent_id": null, "filename": "BBC Sport - Premier League 2024-2025 - Chelsea vs Manchester City Premier League.md", "contents": "Match date: Sun 18 Aug 2024\n\u2027\nPremier League\nChelsea 0 , Manchester City 2 at Full time\nChelseaChelseaChelsea0\n2Man CityManchester CityManchester City\nFull time\nFT\nHalf Time Chelsea 0 , Manchester City 1\nHT 0-1\n### Key Events\n#### Chelsea\n#### Manchester City\n-   E.

In the first half, we ate them alive,\" Ten Hag told Sky Sports.\n\"The second half it was more in the balance but first half, we should have scored one or two goals.\n\"The only thing was in the box, that is where the game is always decided. We should be more clinical there.\"\nSpeaking to BBC Match of the Day, Ten Hag added: \"The performance is good, but for a performance you don\u2019t get points. You have to score a goal.\"\nPalace eventually grew into the half and came closest when Eberechi Eze slotted into the hands of Andre Onana when unmarked on the penalty spot.\nThe second half was more even. Fernandes curled wide before a Garnacho effort was tipped round the post.\nAt the other end, Eddie Nketiah had an effort tipped back into danger by Onana, but the rebound was superbly clawed behind by the Reds keeper.\nThe best chance of the half fell to Eze, though, with the England forward inexcusably missing the target when unmarked from 12 yards.\nThe video assistant referee also cleared a second-half challenge by Martinez, with the Argentina defender leaving the ground and lunging in two-footed, but no contact was made with Daichi Kamada.\nThe point leaves United 11th and Palace still winless in 16th.\n-   Have your say on Crystal Palace\u2019s performance\n    \n-   What did you make of Man Utd\u2019s display?\n    \n## Same old story for United\nThis video can not be played\n## To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\nMedia caption,\nCrystal Palace 0-0 Man Utd: You don't get points for performance - Ten Hag\nDuring their journey back to Manchester Ten Hag will reflect and feel this is a game his side should have won.\nThere were positives - their 66.8% share of possession was their most in an away game since April 2023, for example.\nHowever, old weaknesses were glaringly obvious again.\nWhile no gilt-edged chances were missed, the United boss will feel his side created more than enough to take the three points.\nMartinez will believe he should have scored after the ball fell kindly from a corner, while Garnacho and particularly Fernandes will rue hitting the woodwork.\nUnited have the second-highest xG (expected goals) in the league, at 9.53 from their opening five games, but have only managed to score five times.\nOnly Southampton, who sit 18th, are underperforming their xG by more.\nOne positive for United was the return of Denmark striker Rasmus Hojlund from injury.\nThe 21-year-old came off the bench late in the second half for his first appearance of the season - and adds to the options available to Ten Hag alongside Netherlands striker Joshua Zirkzee, who was well marshalled by the Palace defence.\n## Palace resilient but lack cutting edge\nThis video can not be played\n## To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\nMedia caption,\nCrystal Palace 0-0 Man Utd: Glasner says 'Palace very passive'\nOliver Glasner\u2019s side could, and perhaps should, have been trailing by a considerable margin after the opening half an hour.\nThey struggled to get a foothold in the game, often camped deep in their own half, and were indebted to Henderson for some brilliant reaction saves to deny Martinez and De Ligt.\nThe Eagles were stronger as the game progressed, and will feel they created the better opportunities on reflection.\nEze's two unmarked chances - one in each half - should have resulted in at least one goal, while Sarr will replay his miss over and over again.\nHe had to readjust his body quickly after Onana\u2019s parry back into the penalty area, and was unable to lift over the Reds keeper - who leapt to his left and raised his left arm brilliantly to turn behind for a corner.\nA first league win awaits but three draws in a row, and progression in the EFL Cup, shows Palace are settling into the season after losing Michael Olise to Bayern Munich and Joachim Andersen to Fulham.\nSpeaking to BBC Match of the Day, Glasner said: \"Dean Henderson kept us alive and in the first half we have never played like this.\n\"We played without courage in and out of possession.

The Brazilian's shot was blocked but Palace failed to clear the loose ball, allowing Soucek to side-foot home.\nAs Soucek and his team-mates celebrated near the away end, one of the advertising boards in front of the visiting supporters gave way, falling on top of a ball boy sitting in front.\nThe Czech Republic midfielder quickly spotted the danger and lifted up the board, allowing Bowen to pull the youngster - who appeared shaken up but unharmed - back to his feet.\n\"I managed to grab him out as quickly as possible,\" Bowen told BBC Match of the Day. \"It was just instinct. I've seen him after the game \u2013 he's got my top and he's smiling.\"\nThe forward then put the seal on a hard-fought Hammers victory, shooting low into Henderson\u2019s bottom left corner after running onto Max Kilman's precise pass and sidestepping Palace defender Chadi Riad.\nNot only was this West Ham's first triumph over Palace since January 2022, it was also their first top-flight clean sheet in 20 matches, the last coming in a goalless draw with Brighton in January this year.\n\"We were able to compete and be resilient,\" Lopetegui said. \"They\u2019ve only lost to \\[Manchester\\] City at home \\[under Oliver Glasner\\], so we knew it would be difficult.\n\"When you win, you need to be balanced. We have to improve and we have a lot to do.\"\n## Eagles pay for first-half wastefulness\nThis video can not be played\n## To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\nMedia caption,\n'No excuse' for Palace's defeat - Glasner\nFollowing the departures of Joachim Andersen and Jordan Ayew this week - and with the future of Marc Guehi still unresolved - Palace manager Glasner will be looking to add one or two reinforcements to his squad before the summer transfer window closes on 30 August.\nThis result highlighted Palace's need to strengthen in attacking areas, with Eze and Edouard particularly wasteful in the first half.\nEze shot straight at Areola with only the Hammers goalkeeper to beat, before Edouard dragged a right-footed shot well wide of the far post from an equally promising position.\nEngland international Eze was inches away from giving Palace the lead shortly before the interval, his brilliant curling effort from the corner of the penalty area failing to dip under the crossbar.\nSecond-half substitute Ismaila Sarr was also denied by the post late on as the Eagles slumped to a second consecutive Premier League defeat.\n\u201cWe\u2019re all disappointed,\" Glasner said. \"It\u2019s a little bit like deja vu from the last game \\[against Brentford\\]. It\u2019s a game we didn\u2019t have to lose.\n\"Everybody\u2019s talking about the end of last season, but we have to accept the reality. The reality is that we\u2019ve lost two games, so we have to get back to a situation where we can win games.\"\nThe reverse brings an end to the Eagles' run of four consecutive home league victories, while this was also the first time striker Jean-Philippe Mateta has failed to find the net at Selhurst Park since Glasner replaced Roy Hodgson in the hot seat.\nThe Player Rater cannot be displayed in your browser.

Since the Austrian\u2019s appointment, they are yet to win a Premier League match in which they have trailed.\nPalace debutant Eddie Nketiah failed to make the scoresheet but his movement off the ball was excellent at times. He was unlucky not to make it 2-2 after Mateta - who was deemed onside from Mitchell's cross - had reduced the arrears, his rasping drive flying narrowly wide of the far post.\nLacroix, on the other hand, endured a frustrating first outing in a Palace shirt, after his misplaced clearance allowed Ndidi to square the ball for Mavididi for Leicester\u2019s second.\nPalace captain Marc Guehi was also guilty of some questionable defending in the first half, but the visitors were unable to take advantage.\n## Frustration for improving Foxes\nThis video can not be played\n## To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\nMedia caption,\nPalace draw 'feels like a defeat' - Cooper\nLike their opponents, Leicester went into Saturday\u2019s game without a league win but they should have taken the lead before Vardy\u2019s opener.\nJordan Ayew, returning to Selhurst Park for the first time since joining the Foxes from Palace last month, was left unmarked at the far post but failed to make proper contact with Mavididi\u2019s looping cross, after the winger had dispossessed Guehi.\nVardy cut a frustrated figure against Aston Villa a fortnight ago but made no mistake to give his team the lead here, showing tremendous composure to take Ndidi\u2019s pass in his stride and slide the ball home from a tight angle.\nThe veteran frontman almost turned provider before the interval, capitalising on another Guehi error before squaring for Mavididi, who failed to steer his effort on target.\nMavididi made amends in the opening minute of the second half, but it was not enough to earn the visitors a first league win of the campaign.\nThey defended resolutely for much of the second half, but Coady\u2019s lunging tackle on Sarr proved costly.\nThe Player Rater cannot be displayed in your browser.

They worked quite hard in pre-season and I am very proud and happy for them.\"\nTackles flew in during a thunderous first half in which Everton's Jack Harrison had an early goal ruled out for offside, while at the other end Joao Pedro rattled the post with a stinging low drive.\nThe visitors took the lead courtesy of Kaoru Mitoma's easy finish at the back post following fine work from debutant Yankuba Minteh, who was heavily linked with a move to Everton before joining Brighton this summer.\nEverton had a penalty award overturned at the start of the second half despite Lewis Dunk appearing to catch Dominic Calvert-Lewin, as referee Simon Hooper reviewed the incident on the pitchside monitor.\nFeeling hard done by, Everton were then punished further as Idrissa Gueye misplaced a pass in midfield, allowing the Seagulls to counter, and Danny Welbeck stroked in a lovely finish from the edge of the box.\nEverton's Ashley Young was sent off as the last man for pulling back Japan international Mitoma, and Simon Adingra slid home a third goal late on to inflict a thoroughly desperate opening defeat on the home side.\n-   Dyche laments 'horrible game' as Everton humbled\n    \n    -   Published\n        \n        17 August\n        \n    \n-   Have your say on Everton's performance\n    \n-   What did you make of Brighton's display?\n    \n## Mitoma the star of the show\n\n\nImage source, Getty Images\nImage caption,\nBrighton's Kaoru Mitoma scored only three goals last season but is already off the mark this term\nEyebrows were raised during the summer when Brighton replaced the experienced Roberto de Zerbi, who left by mutual agreement, with relative unknown Hurzeler as their new manager.\nThe German had achieved success in his homeland by guiding St Pauli into the Bundesliga and it was enough for the Seagulls to take a chance on his services.\nAt 31 years and 173 days old, German Hurzeler became the youngest permanent manager of a Premier League team and the first boss to be born after the competition started in 1992.\nThe former Germany youth international gave debuts to summer signings Minteh and Mats Wieffer, but it was the inclusion of veteran James Milner that initially sparked the most interest.\nThe ex-Liverpool and Manchester City utility man signed a new contract in the summer and is seven years older than his boss, while his selection allowed him to appear in the Premier League for a record 23rd campaign.\nHurzeler was just nine years of age when Milner made his Premier League debut in November 2002.\nIt was Milner's team-mate Mitoma who was the star of the show, running Everton defenders ragged throughout and capping his superb performance with a goal.\nThe tricky winger could have had more goals, but a poked effort and a low drive were kept out by England international Jordan Pickford.\nThe joyous travelling fans thought they were celebrating a fourth goal in injury time but substitute Yasin Ayari's effort from close range was chalked off for offside, though it did not dampen their spirits as they were left singing at full-time.\nHurzeler said: \"It was a good result. It was a tough game, especially the first minutes. It was really intense and a loud atmosphere and we suffered in some moments, but we defended quite good. After that we tried to control the game and we had very good chances.\n\"We went 1-0 up and then it was helpful for us to control the game and have ball possession. In the end, a clean sheet is so important to win games in the Premier League and everyone was responsible today in defending their own box.\n\"It showed the attitude and character of the players so I am very happy for them. It was a good start, nothing more, and now we try to keep working to stay humble after a win like this.\"\n-   'I don't have to shine individually'\n    \n    -   Published\n        \n        14 August\n        \n    \n-   Fabian Hurzeler: The manager & the man\n    \nThis video can not be played\n## To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\nMedia caption,\nSean Dyche responds after a tough day for the Toffees\n## Another season of struggle for Everton?\nThis may yet become a celebratory season for Everton, aiming to bid farewell to their much-loved home ground in style, but at the end of Saturday's game there were no cheers ringing out from home sections.\nInstead, jeers echoed around Goodison from the hardened supporters who remained until the final whistle, as the heavy defeat left the Toffees slumped at the bottom of the table after their first game.\nSean Dyche's side have battled at the wrong end of the table for the last three campaigns and early signs point to perhaps another season of struggle.\nThe game could have panned out differently had Harrison's early strike stood, but in truth Everton were second best for much of the contest and failed to force Brighton goalkeeper Jason Steele into any meaningful saves.\nEverton could have had a penalty but referee Hooper changed his mind after being asked by the video assistant referee to review his decision. He ruled in Brighton's favour, despite it appearing as though the main VAR monitor was not functioning correctly, with Hooper said to have had a back-up screen available.\nDyche said: \"The way we performed in the first half was decent and as good as I was hoping for, but one of the biggest challenges is finding the clinical moments which we didn't do.\n\"A big decision on the penalty - I can't really work it out. We go to these meetings, we have literally been told the bar is going to be incredibly high for the referee to make a decision; he makes a clear decision from a perfect viewing point and lo and behold he is called over to overturn the decision.\n\"You are like, what is the point having a high bar then? We are all confused by it.\"\nMidfielder Tim Iroegbunam stuck to his task and had a shot that curled wide in the opening period, while fellow debutant Iliman Ndiaye was unable to make an impact when brought on with half an hour remaining as Everton began with a disheartening loss.\nThe Player Rater cannot be displayed in your browser.

They frustrated Liverpool but did not have a single shot before the break.\nHowever, Nuno was brave in the second half, bringing on Hudson-Odoi and Elanga when the temptation might have been to shore things up - and it paid off.\nElanga found Hudson-Odoi, who cut inside Conor Bradley before swinging in his sweet shot into the bottom corner.\nElanga almost doubled their lead late on when he shot straight at Alisson.\nBut one goal was enough, and they won at Anfield for the first time since the first man landed on the Moon.\n## Frustrating day for Liverpool\nThis video can not be played\n## To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\nMedia caption,\nLiverpool 0-1 Nottingham Forest: Arne Slot reaction\nFormer Feyenoord boss Slot will have known it would not all be plain sailing in the Premier League.\nBut the start he had, including the hugely impressive win over Manchester United before the international break, had people favourably comparing his set-up to Jurgen Klopp's.\nPatience, passing and build-up is their style now. And for a while, it looked like their patience would eventually be rewarded.\nDiaz hit the post, several headers went off target, and Mohamed Salah forced a good save from Sels at his near post.\nSlot brought on Bradley, pushing Trent Alexander-Arnold into midfield, and introduced Cody Gakpo and Darwin Nunez as he tried to find the winner.\nBut in the end, Bradley was beaten for the only goal of the game.\nThe hosts had one late chance to level when Virgil van Dijk headed over, but many fans were leaving Anfield before the final whistle went to confirm the end of their unbeaten start.\nThe Player Rater cannot be displayed in your browser.

To play my first game at Craven Cottage and get the three points, I'm really happy,\" Smith Rowe said.\nFaes' equaliser 20 minutes later was initially ruled out by referee Darren Bond, who judged Jamie Vardy to have been interfering with Bernd Leno in an offside position.\nBut the video assistant referee sent Bond to the pitchside monitor and he overturned the decision after seeing replays of the Fulham goalkeeper pushing Vardy out his way.\nThe visitors struggled for possession after Iwobi\u2019s goal and lacked a clinical edge as they pushed for a late equaliser with Wilfred Ndidi coming closest, only to slam his shot straight at Leno in the final moments of injury time.\nIt is a first win of the season for Marco Silva's side, who came away from their opener at Manchester United empty-handed, losing 1-0 to a late goal.\n## Fulham find a way against Foxes\nThis video can not be played\n## To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\nMedia caption,\nFulham played with intensity to win - Silva\nFulham may have felt hard done by coming away from Old Trafford last week without a point, having started brightly.\nA point here would have been equally disappointing, given they threatened constantly, peppering Leicester's goal with 18 shots.\nSilva said on Friday the club still needed to sign a forward, but Smith Rowe showed a striker's instinct when he calmly lifted the ball over Hermansen and into the net.\nIwobi, too, carried the same clinical edge - waiting for the Leicester keeper to make his move before picking out his shot.\nAsked about Smith Rowe's price tag, Silva said: \"It's not best to think about whether he is the club record or not.\n\"We recognise his quality, I am sure he is going to be important as he was today. I am sure he is going to be even more important in the future.\"\nFulham have continued to strengthen and had a busy week in the transfer window, paying more than \u00a350m to bring in Sander Berge and Joachim Andersen.\nThe pair received a warm welcome from Fulham fans before kick-off but neither player was named in the matchday squad.\n## Leicester unconvincing at both ends of pitch\nThis video can not be played\n## To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\nMedia caption,\nLeicester punished by ruthlessness of league - Cooper\nAs was the case in their 1-1 draw against Tottenham last Monday, Steve Cooper's side were outfought in every area of the pitch.\nUnlike Spurs, however, Fulham were able to keep Jamie Vardy at bay - and so Leicester were unable to find a way to a point this time.\nThe 37-year-old veteran striker had just 12 touches and failed to register a shot before he was replaced by Stephy Mavididi in the 71st minute.\nAt the other end of the pitch, Leicester looked unconvincing.\nThey were lucky not to concede more in the first half with Hermansen producing brilliant saves to keep out Traore, Iwobi and Rodrigo Muniz.\nLeicester centre-back Jannik Vestergaard nearly scored an own goal early in the second half when his defensive header looped over Hermansen and on to the roof of the net.\nFaes, too, was let off the hook after a risky flick in his own box gave Fulham possession, but Muniz couldn't capitalise and fired over the crossbar.\n-   What did you make of Fulham\u2019s display?\n    \n-   Have your say on Leicester\u2019s performance\n    \nThe Player Rater cannot be displayed in your browser.

I've got to keep going and keep working hard,\" he said.\n\"Everyone knows it has been a tough couple of seasons for me. I have to stay fit and I feel good at the moment. I'm feeling confident and happy.\"\nThis video can not be played\n## To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\nMedia caption,\nFulham 3-1 Newcastle United: Silva on feeling clear and deserving 'more points'\nSmith Rowe's performance was not the only positive for Fulham.\nSeasoned Mexico striker Jimenez has taken his chance after being restored as a starter ahead of Rodrigo Muniz, while Adama Traore's pace offered another threat in a formidable front four.\nFulham have paid the price for being wasteful this season - notably in an opening-day defeat at Manchester United and last weekend's draw against West Ham.\nSo the way in which they saw off Newcastle was a source of pride for boss Marco Silva.\n\"It was a great, great first half and we created many problems for them,\" he said.\n\"It was the same against West Ham - we scored just one when we should have scored three or four. This was the same.\n\"In the Premier League you have to be clinical. But the performances are good and you can see how this team is growing. We have been showing quality.\"\n## Newcastle unable to muster another late flurry\nWith Manchester City and Arsenal playing on Sunday, Newcastle knew they could temporarily jump to the top of the table - an encouraging sight if not a realistic sign of where Eddie Howe's side are at.\nEven though they had not lost in their opening four league games, there remained a strong sense the Magpies were still far from their best.\nThat view were substantiated in a first half during which Newcastle lacked solidity in their defensive shape and assurance on the ball to stem the tide.\n\"It was a slow start and the first goal was a killer blow for us,\" said Howe.\nA disjointed display left cause for concern and Howe reacted by making a double change at the break.\nJacob Murphy, who was introduced alongside Lewis Hall, made an immediate impact by driving forward with the pace and purpose his side had lacked.\nA measured pass into the path of Barnes, supporting on Murphy\u2019s left, allowed the winger to calmly cut inside before drilling into the bottom corner.\nBelief was back. Newcastle continued to play with more urgency and clarity to leave the game delicately poised.\nLate goals have been a common theme in their encouraging start, leading to the back-to-back wins against Tottenham and Wolves.\nHowever, they were unable to grab another and missed the chance to go unbeaten in their opening five top-flight matches for the first time since 2011-12.\n\"Games swing on big moments,\" Howe said when asked about Schar not taking his chance to level.\n\"The character and attitude was better in that second period but we have to learn our lessons from the first half.\"\nThis video can not be played\n## To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\nMedia caption,\nFulham 3-1 Newcastle United: Game was a 'killer blow' - Eddie Howe\nThe Player Rater cannot be displayed in your browser.

We were solid, we did not give many things but we did not create.\n\"We should create a lot more when we are on the ball, we have to be more effective in our build up and have more chances to score.\"\nThe Player Rater cannot be displayed in your browser.

None were on target.\nBut the visitors began the second period with far greater urgency and Salah had a goal-bound effort blocked by Greaves, before Luis Diaz blazed over after cutting on to his right foot from the left flank.\nIpswich were suddenly struggling to get out of their own half and were given a let-off when Jota headed wide, but Liverpool's pressure finally told when the forward converted Salah's pass.\nThe Egyptian went from provider to goalscorer not long afterwards, his close-range finish meaning he has scored in all but one of Liverpool's opening-day fixtures since signing for the club.\n## Positives for Ipswich despite defeat\nThis video can not be played\n## To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\nMedia caption,\nIpswich 0-2 Liverpool: Kieran McKenna reaction\nKieran McKenna has turned Portman Road into a fortress during his time in charge, with Saturday\u2019s reverse only their second defeat in their past 40 home league games.\nThe Tractor Boys, who fielded seven players who started their final League One home game in 2022-23, showed plenty of promise in the early stages as Greaves and Hutchinson both tested Alisson.\nHowever, they were perhaps fortunate to end the first half with a full complement of players after Wes Burns - already on a yellow card for an earlier challenge - appeared to bat the ball away with his arm in a coming-together with Jota.\nMcKenna will have been delighted with his team's display before the break, but the hosts were no match for their opponents after the restart as they struggled to repel wave after wave of Liverpool attacks.\nSammie Szmodics, who joined the club from Blackburn on Friday, came on for his Ipswich debut with 15 minutes remaining, but the Reds were already out of sight by that point.\nKalvin Phillips, meanwhile, was an unused substitute after completing a season-long loan move from champions Manchester City - Ipswich's opponents next weekend.\nThe Player Rater cannot be displayed in your browser.

Bournemouth had the better chances, but they found converting them into clear-cut opportunities difficult.\nThat ultimately proved costly for Iraola's men, who had 19 shots and seven on target without scoring.\n## Nkunku's heroics to the rescue\nThis video can not be played\n## To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\nMedia caption,\nBournemouth 0-1 Chelsea: Enzo Maresca reaction\nThere were promising elements in Chelsea's performance, but the game equally exposed a number of issues for manager Maresca - especially in their defence.\nChelsea were often sloppy in their attempts to build up, failing to sustain possession and instead gifting Bournemouth chances. It was only the hosts' final product that prevented the visitors from conceding.\nThere were some good moments for Chelsea, particularly in their forward movement. But they struggled to adequately express themselves, instead making nice moves that resulted in little of note until Nkunku notched the late winner.\nNicolas Jackson earlier spurned an excellent chance to snatch the lead, firing straight to the palms of Travers when slipped through one-on-one.\nIntroducing Manchester United loanee Sancho at half-time proved crucial, with his footwork carving out opportunities before he eventually delivered the all-important through-ball to set up Nkunku.\nThe Player Rater cannot be displayed in your browser.

It is fair to say I didn't need it. I have never experienced conditions as bad as that.\"\nEverton got the perfect start on 12 minutes courtesy of Iliman Ndiaye's first Premier League goal, collecting Ashley Young's fizzed pass and squeezing home a low effort in off the post.\nLeicester fans thought their side had levelled when Mavididi's cross was pushed on to the crossbar by Jordan Pickford before bouncing down, though referee Darren England made it clear the ball had not crossed the line.\nFollowing a short delay to the second half because of the adverse weather, home goalkeeper Mads Hermansen made a fine reflex save to deny Dominic Calvert-Lewin and it proved costly for the visitors.\nAfter Jordan Ayew's acrobatic effort and Harry Winks' long-range curler both drifted over, Mavididi reacted quickest at a corner with a swivelled 73rd-minute finish to grab a valuable point for Steve Cooper's team.\n-   Follow live coverage of Saturday's Premier League games\n    \n-   Have your say on Leicester\u2019s performance\n    \n-   What did you make of Everton\u2019s display?\n    \n## Lindstrom's finishing issues hurt Toffees\nFor the fourth consecutive game, Everton will be left wondering what might have been as they let slip another lead - but this point allowed them to move off the foot of the table.\nThe Toffees had lost their previous two league games 3-2, having been 2-0 ahead, and were knocked out of the Carabao Cup on penalties by Southampton on Tuesday after relinquishing a 1-0 advantage.\nThey failed to build on Ndiaye's well-taken opener and similar to the game during the week, on-loan winger Jesper Lindstrom was guilty of missing numerous presentable openings.\nThe Dane volleyed wide at the far post inside the opening five minutes when he should really have buried the chance, while a thumping drive was kept out by Hermansen and another effort was blazed over from the angle.\nWithout a number of first-team players through a combination of injury and illness, Everton seemed to run out of puff towards the end and were holding on by the full-time whistle as their winless run on the road extended to 15 games.\n\"I thought that from us it was a positive display,\" said Dyche. \"There have been question marks around us not winning, but we have got our nose in front and I thought we delivered a good performance.\n\"I think it is a point gained because we needed one, or three obviously. There was positivity in the performance. We put hard yards in. There are loads of question marks over myself, the players - lots of noise and negativity shrouding the situation.\n\"It is difficult for players but there was real confidence and belief in our performance. That shows the mentality.\"\n## Foxes battle back but Cooper's winless run continues\nThe rain threatened to dampen Leicester's day and, while their return to the top light has not been perfect, they have collected three draws from their opening five games to lie 15th in the table.\nBut they will need to start picking up victories quickly if they are to survive, particularly manager Cooper, whose winless run in the division - including his time at previous club Nottingham Forest - extended to 18 games.\nThe Foxes were relegated two seasons ago with a costly draw towards the end of the campaign against Everton and have now failed to keep a home clean sheet in their past 16 Premier League games.\nWith a measure of revenge in mind, they battled back courtesy of a scrambled strike from Mavididi, who span on a loose ball and fired into the roof of the net past the Everton backline.\nBefore that, Italian centre-back Caleb Okoli somehow sent a free header over the crossbar from five yards out and, despite a late push, they were unable to find a winner.\nCooper said: \"We definitely were the stronger team in the second half but nowhere near the level in the first half. We wanted to take the game to Everton, attack the game and we did everything but that.\n\"We were deservedly losing the game and the players knew that. I told them as well. When that happens, you can go under and hide, and the game can go worse, or you can do what we did. We ran a bit more, fought and won duels and tackles.\n\"We finished a lot stronger but only managed to get the point. It is a game and result that should have been better but the way the game played out, it could have been worse.\"\nThe Player Rater cannot be displayed in your browser.

Let us know here\n    \n## Duran strikes again \u2013 but Watkins\u2019 wait goes on\nThe victory was Villa\u2019s 16th away in the Premier League under Emery \u2013 only Arsenal and Manchester City have won more games on the road since the Spaniard\u2019s appointment \u2013 and the ideal response to last weekend\u2019s defeat by the Gunners.\nThough not at their free-flowing best, Villa should have been further ahead at the interval after Watkins twice failed to get the better of Hermansen when one-on-one with the Leicester goalkeeper.\nThe England international was played through by Tielemans after just two minutes but Hermansen managed to claw the ball away at the feet of the striker, who was denied by another sprawling save midway through the first half.\nWatkins has now gone seven top-flight appearances without a goal, his longest barren run since an eight-game streak between August and October 2022 just prior to Emery\u2019s arrival.\nDuran, by contrast, has hit the ground running this season, doubling his personal tally for the campaign just two minutes after replacing the England man.\nThe Colombia international was heavily linked with a move to West Ham in the summer but after scoring Villa\u2019s second in their 2-1 opening-day victory over the Hammers, he struck again at King Power Stadium to give his team a crucial two-goal cushion.\n\u201cTo get three points here today is fantastic,\u201d Emery told BBC Match of the Day.\n\u201cWe competed very well in the first match against West Ham, in the second game against Arsenal and again here today.\n\u201cWe have some days off now. We want a rest. We need to prepare for the next weeks in the Premier League and the Champions League.\u201d\n## Too little, too late from Leicester\nThere was no shortage of commitment from Leicester, but the Foxes \u2013 who improved in the second half and could have snatched a late equaliser \u2013 ultimately paid the price for a slow start.\nHad it not been for goalkeeper Hermansen, Villa would have been out of sight by half-time.\nAfter twice denying Watkins, the Dane almost gifted the striker an opener when he let Caleb Okoli\u2019s pass slip under his foot before recovering in time to clear the danger.\nHowever, there was nothing he could do to keep out Onana\u2019s close-range finish in the first half, while Duran\u2019s header also sailed beyond the reach of the 24-year-old.\nReferee David Coote left the field to a chorus of boos from the Leicester fans, who felt the hosts should have been awarded a late chance to equalise from the penalty spot when Konsa upended Vardy \u2013 although the veteran striker appeared to be just offside when El Khannouss played the ball.\nCoote had already incurred the wrath of the home supporters by disallowing a Vardy goal earlier in the second half, after Harry Winks\u2019 through-ball had clipped the referee\u2019s heels in the build-up.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a tough one to take,\u201d said Cooper, who was also unhappy with Coote\u2019s decision to award Villa a free-kick for Oliver Skipp\u2019s challenge on Watkins prior to the visitors\u2019 opener. \u201cIt\u2019s something you have to contend with, but you take a deep breath and accept that\u2019s how it is.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen more than enough in the three performances to feel like we\u2019re going to be OK \\[in the Premier League\\]. We\u2019re disappointed with the defeat, but if we stay as we are and improve in areas we want to, we\u2019ll be all right.\u201d\nThe Player Rater cannot be displayed in your browser.

It is very early days, but this performance will give the Tottenham boss plenty of think about.\nThe Player Rater cannot be displayed in your browser.

He is one of the fastest, most direct players in the game and because of that, he is a major danger. But too often, the threat he poses peters out into very little.\nIt was the same here. Traore flew into the box, got himself into the perfect position to cut the ball back to a team-mate, and allowed the pass to be intercepted by United debutant Noussair Mazraoui.\nHe was off target with a decent chance not long afterwards and when he attacked the home goal for a third time, Lisandro Martinez stepped in to simply ease him away from the ball.\nThis all meant Fulham failed to make the most of their best spell and once Pereira contrived to blow one chance and Martinez was then allowed to snuff out the danger from what was initially a four-on-two counter, they were always at risk of a nasty late surprise.\nThe Player Rater cannot be displayed in your browser.

He scored a second before the break as he outmuscled Ethan Pinnock to reach Ederson's long punt forward.\nIt left Haaland tantalisingly close to becoming only the fifth player in English top-flight history - and the first since 1946 - to score three successive hat-tricks.\nHe came close. Brentford keeper Mark Flekken tipped one goal-bound effort over the bar. Haaland then sent an instinctive first-time strike against the post and was unable to get enough power behind the rebound to take it into the net.\nBut, despite the crowd clearly willing him on, dad Alfie watching from the stands and manager Pep Guardiola opting not to take him off even though his side start their Champions League campaign with a 2023 final rematch against Inter Milan on Wednesday, this time Haaland had to settle for two.\n-   'Question of time' before Frank manages big club - Guardiola\n    \n    -   Published\n        \n        14 September\n        \n    \n-   Have your say on Man City\u2019s performance\n    \n-   What did you make of Brentford\u2019s display?\n    \n## Haaland's on fire\nThis video can not be played\n## To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\nMedia caption,\nGuardiola praises Haaland after 'tough week'\nAs the game ticked into injury time, Haaland was confirmed as the club man of the match.\nHe has now taken his overall tally for City to 99 in 103 appearances. His Premier League ratio is more than one a game.\nTo put that into context, legendary striker Sergio Aguero took 390 games to score his club record 260 for the club. At the current rate, Haaland will overhaul the Argentine within three seasons.\nAnd the secondary point is he scores goals from nothing, which, on days like these, is absolutely priceless.\nNew arrival Savinho looks a major threat. But despite getting himself into a couple of excellent positions, he could not convert.\nIt has been said Haaland doesn't contribute to City's overall game and sometimes restricts their fluidity. But he also ensures they win matches when they might drop points, as they almost certainly would have on this occasion had he not made his personal intervention.\nIt wasn't just about Haaland. There was also evidence of Jack Grealish's return to form with a smart effort that required a full-length low save from Flekken. A week out from a meeting with old rivals Arsenal, Rodri made his seasonal bow as a second-half substitute, although Phil Foden remained on the bench.\nBut Haaland took the accolades, which, given the personal sadness he has had to deal with this week, seemed fitting.\n## Brentford frustration\nThis video can not be played\n## To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\nMedia caption,\nFrank 'disappointed but proud' after defeat at Man City\nAs Bryan Mbeumo found himself through on goal but failed to convert as Rico Lewis sped back to intervene, a member of the Brentford backroom staff, observing proceedings from the media seats, slammed his hand with some force into the desk in front of him.\nIt was a good chance. But the underlying frustration went beyond that single moment.\nEven though the game was just minutes old, there was a sense City would not continue in the same manner they had started the game.\nThere were more opportunities for the visitors before the break. Ederson raced from his goal just in time to prevent Wissa getting to the ball with no-one else near, Mbuemo failed to make contact with an ambitious attempted overhead kick. Ederson produced a smart reaction save on his goal-line to deny Nathan Collins and the Brazilian also foiled Lewis-Potter.\nIt was a volume of opportunities Brentford cannot have expected. The fact they delivered a single goal meant they had not exploited their good work.\nGuardiola's decision to bring on Rodri and Josko Gvardiol during the interval was proof the City boss had got the make up of his team wrong.\nCity weren't perfect after that but Brentford had lost some of their energy. Mbeumo went the wrong way when a pass to his right would have set up Kevin Shade and Yehor Yarmolyuk wasted a decent opportunity late on. But in reality, Brentford's chance of victory disappeared as the media desk table was shaking much earlier in the afternoon.\nThe Player Rater cannot be displayed in your browser.

Postecoglou need not have worried.\nFernandes' red card aided their cause but they had United where they wanted them long before then, and once Kulusevski added a second the deal was sealed, with Solanke's third adding the final flourish.\nJohnson's early strike was understandably greeted ecstatically by his father David, who started his career at Manchester United, and who watching from the directors\u2019 box. It was another strong response from a player who was upset by recent heavy criticism from Spurs fans.\nHe scored for the fourth successive game and created Kulusevski's second, playing a key part as Spurs threatened to run riot.\nUnited had rare moments in the second half but this was Spurs' day and they thoroughly deserved the standing ovation they received from their elated fans at the final whistle.\n## Ten Hag in turmoil once more\nThis video can not be played\n## To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\nMedia caption,\nManchester United 0-3 Tottenham: Maddison foul 'never a red card' - Bruno Fernandes\nTen Hag has reached the stage at Manchester United where he is only ever one bad defeat away from a crisis. On that basis alone, this was a desperate day for the Dutchman.\nTen Hag might point towards the dismissal of Fernandes, which did not help - but United were being given a fearful going over by Spurs long before their captain went for lunging at Maddison after slipping on the sodden Old Trafford turf.\nUnited's inferiority to Spurs was embarrassing. Only goalkeeper Onana emerged with any credit for two fine saves from Werner when the forward was clean through and another from Solanke, who had looked poised to rub further salt in the wounds with a fourth.\nIt was not simply the abject manner of United's effort as they dropped into the bottom half of the Premier League table that was so alarming. This was a tactically bankrupt and wildly indisciplined display.\nMason Mount summed up United's lack of control seconds after coming on in the aftermath of Fernandes' red card, needlessly clattering into the back of Rodrigo Bentancur to pick up a senseless yellow card. Lisandro Martinez was equally culpable for a foul on Maddison.\nIt will, of course, be Ten Hag who will come under scrutiny. He has no place to hide after this beating.\nUnited show few signs of improving or any signs that they are better than last season.\nThese are difficult days for Ten Hag - days that will be testing the patience of the Old Trafford hierarchy who finally kept faith with him in the summer after a post-season review.\nThis video can not be played\n## To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\nMedia caption,\nManchester United 0-3 Tottenham: 'Not a red card' - Erik ten Hag on Bruno Fernandes\nThe Player Rater cannot be displayed in your browser.

Another summer acquisition in Leny Yoro is injured, as are Mason Mount, Luke Shaw and Rasmus Hojlund.\nSuch factors cannot disguise, however, the lack of quality in this United side as Liverpool taught them a harsh lesson in control, intensity and end product.\nThis was exemplified by the sight of Casemiro, the once great midfield man at Real Madrid, who looked a spent force last season and would have left in the summer had United been able to find a buyer, playing so poorly that Ten Hag was prepared to send on 20-year-old Toby Collyer to replace him for the second half.\nThe Premier League season may only be in its infancy but defeats of this nature will inevitably put Ten Hag under the microscope in such a vital campaign \u2013 and the problem with handing a manager what effectively appeared to be a stay of execution is that they are always one bad result away from speculation.\nThis is why this meeting with old adversaries Liverpool was so vital and the manner in which United were beaten may prove to be so significant.\n-   Have your say on Manchester United's performance\n    \n-   What did you make of Liverpool's display? Let us know here\n    \n## Slot's evolution gathers pace\nThis video can not be played\n## To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\nMedia caption,\nSlot 'impressed' with hard-working Liverpool\nPremier League newcomer Slot made a smooth start at Liverpool with victories away at newly promoted Ipswich Town and at home against Brentford \u2013 but a trip to Old Trafford was regarded as the first serious examination of the new post-Klopp era.\nThis emphatic win came at a ground where Klopp\u2019s Liverpool lost in the FA Cup quarter-final last season and were also held to a draw in April, a result that damaged their chances of challenging Arsenal and Manchester City in the title race.\nThose two games were perfect examples of the wonderfully entertaining, but occasionally chaotic, brand of football Klopp delivered at Liverpool as they lost control on both occasions after dominating.\nSlot still has all of Liverpool's attacking tools at his disposal but is clearly intent on adding a layer of measured control to their style, which his team showed here as they were never in danger of relinquishing their hold on affairs once Diaz had given them that two-goal advantage.\nOn the rare occasions United did threaten, Liverpool goalkeeper Alisson demonstrated his world-class quality, frustrating the erratic Zirkzee in particular.\nIn pretty much every other respect, this was business as usual for Liverpool - a side full of threat, especially in the shape of Salah, who has made such a habit of tormenting United and did so again.\nThis was, however, a complete Liverpool performance which left Slot and his players taking the acclaim of their elated supporters at the final whistle.\nAnd as Slot's name rang out, the Dutchman responded with a modest wave and a clenched fist. There were none of Klopp's trademark fist pumps, but the deafening roars from the travelling fans suggested the new boss has already won those Liverpool hearts.\nThe Player Rater cannot be displayed in your browser.

After Pedro Porro's shot had been deflected on to the crossbar moments earlier, half-time substitute Brennan Johnson had his shot sliced into his own goal by Newcastle defender Dan Burn.\nKeeper Nick Pope then tipped over James Maddison's curled effort and Johnson fired over as Spurs piled on the pressure.\nHowever, against the run of play, Newcastle regained their lead with 12 minutes left.\nJoelinton started the move with excellent work in midfield and he released substitute Jacob Murphy who ran at the defence and crossed low for Alexander Isak to net the winner.\nIn another boost for Newcastle, Italy midfielder Sandro Tonali made his first Premier League appearance since October after he served a 10-month ban for breaching betting regulations.\nThe 24-year-old, who played in the away Carabao Cup second-round tie against Nottingham Forest on Wednesday, received a standing ovation from the home fans when he came on as a second-half substitute.\nFollow live text and radio coverage of Sunday's Premier League matches.\n-   What did you think about Newcastle's performance?\n    \n-   Have your say on Tottenham's performance\n    \n\n\nImage source, Getty Images\nImage caption,\nHarvey Barnes last scored in his final appearance of last season\n## Missed chances prove costly for Tottenham\nThe win lifted Newcastle up to fifth place on seven points - two behind leaders Manchester City and Liverpool.\n\"We're finding a way to win but in the long term we need to improve our performances,\" admitted boss Eddie Howe. \"We can move forward with positive momentum and it was difficult but we managed to grind out a win.\n\"This does give us confidence and shows we're a very good team, but one that can improve. We need the players to believe and I think they do, but we still have a numbers of players that can make a difference out injured.\"\nTottenham would have gone second with a win, but are now 10th after losing for the first time in this campaign.\nBoss Ange Postecoglou will be wondering how they left the north east without anything to show for their efforts, having been the better team for large parts of the second half and a spell in the middle of the opening period.\nSpurs had two-thirds possession, 20 shots at goal compared to only nine from Newcastle, while the hosts scored from two of their three attempts on target.\nAfter winning 6-1 and 4-0 in their past two home games against the Londoners, Newcastle nearly went ahead after only five minutes.\nBut having stolen the ball from Son Heung-min, Swedish striker Isak was denied by the woodwork when his superb chip left Guglielmo Vicario beaten.\nBarnes, Emil Krafth and Kelly all had chances before a forced delay, which saw fourth official Darren Bond replace injured assistant Ian Hussin, stopped Newcastle's momentum.\nAt the other end Cristian Romero earlier had a header ruled out for offside and Wilson Odobert and Porro missed the target, with Pape Sarr forcing a good save from Pope.\nThey rued those spurned opportunities as, against the run of play, Barnes was given too much space to steer in his first goal of the season.\nThe introduction of Welsh winger Johnson at half-time looked to have transformed the game with Spurs well on top.\nTheir equaliser came after 10 minutes into the second half and, from there, it looked there would only be one winner. But Spurs got hit by another sucker punch as Murphy broke to tee up Isak for his crucial first goal of the campaign.\n\"We needed to kill the game off and we didn't - the game should have been over by then,\" said Postecoglou.\n\"We've not got the results from our performances, but ultimately it's three strong performances.\"\n## Emotional return to St James' Park for Tonali\n\n\nImage source, Getty Images\nImage caption,\nNewcastle fans displayed a large number of flags and banners in support of Sandro Tonali\nTonali was making only his 14th appearance for the club since his \u00a355m move from AC Milan before the start of last season, but has quickly become a fan favourite.\nDozens of flags in Italy colours, with the word 'Sandro' written through the middle, were displayed before the match by the Gallowgate End, along with two huge banners that said 'Midfield maestro from Milano' in tribute.\nTonali received a great reception when he warmed up at the end of the first half, but that was eclipsed when he replaced Sean Longstaff in the 68th minute.\nNewcastle had frustrations in the transfer window, notably a failure to agree a deal with Crystal Palace to sign England defender Marc Guehi, with four offers going up to \u00a365m rejected.\nHowever, the return to Premier League action for Tonali will be like a new signing for Howe.\n\"I didn't know that was going to happen with the wall of flags, so it was a brilliant surprise - visually it was incredible,\" added the Newcastle manager.\n\"Sandro was emotional and his performance when he came on was outstanding. It was just amazing from the fans, it does not surprise me, but it's so important that the relationship between players and supporters is so strong.\n\"It was very different to the Nottingham Forest game. We were in need of a spark and he gave us that.\"\nThe Player Rater cannot be displayed in your browser. Please enable JavaScript or try another browser.\n## Player of the match Number: 11 H.

Ederson was booked and Gordon kept his cool to send the Brazilian the wrong way from the spot.\nPep Guardiola\u2019s side should have been further ahead at the break but Ilkay Gundogan fluffed his attempted chip after Newcastle keeper Nick Pope had presented a clearance straight to City when he was a long way out of his goal.\nBoth sides tried to force a winner, with Newcastle substitute Sean Longstaff going close for the hosts and Bernardo Silva testing Nick Pope deep in stoppage time.\nThe Magpies remain with only one win in 34 top-flight meetings with City, who have have now dropped four points in the space of a week after their 100% start to the campaign.\n## Gvardiol makes an impact\nThis video can not be played\n## To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\nMedia caption,\nMidfield was 'magnificent' despite Rodri absence - Guardiola\nEarlier this week, Guardiola described Rodri as irreplaceable.\nOn every metric, that is probably true. However, there are other members of the City squad who are of huge importance, and not all of them attract the attention devoted to the man who won the Euro 2024 player of the tournament award as he guided Spain to the title.\nEarlier this month, when his team were fortunate to be ahead at half-time against a Brentford side who could easily have had the game wrapped up themselves, Guardiola turned to two men to steady the ship. One was Rodri. The other was Gvardiol. The Croatia defender has not missed a minute of action in the Premier League or Champions League since.\nSigned last summer for \u00a373m, the 22-year-old is built more like a central defender than a full-back. But he has embraced the wider role with gusto. He doesn\u2019t have the blinding pace of Kyle Walker but he is not afraid to make significant incursions into opposition territory and has a pretty accurate left foot.\nWhen Grealish presented him with a shooting opportunity 10 minutes before the break, Gvardiol found the bottom corner with clinical efficiency.\nMany will link the fact it did not prove to be the winner with Rodri\u2019s absence. That would be simplistic. City were not held because they were deficient in midfield. Their overall performance was good. But today, the opposition had a few good players as well.\n## Gordon is Newcastle's main man\nThis video can not be played\n## To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\nMedia caption,\nNewcastle 'brave' in Manchester City draw - Howe\nAs the sides came out, a number of banners were unfurled around St James\u2019 Park celebrating Gordon, who confirmed before the game he is about to sign a new long-term contract that will confirm his status as one of his club\u2019s highest earners.\nIt seems bizarre that earlier in the summer Newcastle spoke to Liverpool to gauge their interest in the former Everton man, yet such is the way of the modern world as clubs try to navigate their way round complicated financial rules.\nGordon is yet to rediscover the form that propelled him into England\u2019s Euro 2024 squad, where he was strangely mostly a spectator.\nHe is a major threat though even if, playing centrally as he was in this match, he cannot find the space he enjoys in wider positions.\nThankfully for him, Walker, stationed 20 yards to his left, offered the opportunity to run onto Guimaraes\u2019 pass. Replays showed little contact from Ederson but the reality was Gordon had to take evasive action to avoid the City goalkeeper. Gordon\u2019s penalty was excellent.\nIt is clear the 23-year-old has a big role to play for Newcastle this season, hence the groans when he briefly looked as though he was injured after a late surge downfield in search of a winner. Gordon eventually got to his feet and appeared to be running freely as the final whistle went.\nHave your say on Newcastle\u2019s performance, external\nWhat did you make of Man City\u2019s display?, external\nThe Player Rater cannot be displayed in your browser.

At 33, Jimenez is clearly relishing every moment.\nThis video can not be played\n## To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\nMedia caption,\nFulham boss Silva impressed with 'quality and maturity' after 1-0 win at Nottingham Forest\nThe Player Rater cannot be displayed in your browser.

It left the Gunners, who had posed real attacking threat, with a backs-to-the-wall task.\nWhat is without question is that Arsenal have once again proved, as they did when winning at Aston Villa and Tottenham, their mettle and stomach for this title fight, pushing City right to the edge and within seconds of their first win at Etihad Stadium since January 2015.\n## Guardiola and Man City live on their nerves\nThis video can not be played\n## To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\nMedia caption,\nMan City 2-2 Arsenal: Pep Guardiola - 'Arsenal showed incredible commitment'\nManchester City boss Guardiola's wild animation throughout the swings of fortunes that characterised this all-action meeting of the Premier League's two superpowers said everything about its importance.\nGuardiola recognises that Arsenal, and his former assistant Arteta, are the biggest threat to City claiming a fifth successive Premier League crown and was keen to strike an early psychological blow.\nHe pumped his fists wildly towards City's fans when intense pressure was rewarded with Haaland's clinical finish after nine minutes, the striker scoring his 100th City goal in 105 appearances from Savinho's inviting through ball.\nGuardiola's joy did not last, kicking his seat in a rage when Calafiori equalised, although whether his anger was because Arsenal had stolen a march with a quick free-kick - or his players were badly caught out - was unclear.\nIt took all City's patience to finally make that late breakthrough when all seemed lost, Guardiola's side lacking their usual fluency without the injured Kevin de Bruyne.\nCity will wait anxiously to discover the extent of Rodri's injury as he appeared to twist his knee in a tangle with Thomas Partey at a corner. It was a painful experience all round for the outstanding midfield who means so much to Guardiola's side, having already been pole-axed by the shoulder of Arsenal's Kai Havertz seconds after kick-off.\nThis was a game that lived up to hype and expectation, with goals incident and controversy - Guardiola celebrating again when Stones pounced at the end of a game that left players, managers and fans drained.\nThis video can not be played\n## To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\nMedia caption,\n'I am proud of the team'- Arteta\nThe Player Rater cannot be displayed in your browser.

We didn't stick to our principles in the details and that's about having enough experience to get through and we didn't do it.\n\"There was so much good stuff but the overriding feeling is being disappointed. We made a few fundamental errors that we haven't done in training so it has to be down to the anxiety.\n\"It was our best performance, but it wasn't enough to get the win so I'm allowed to be angry and annoyed.\"\nSaturday's Premier League matches as they happened, plus reaction and analysis\n\n\nImage source, Getty Images\nImage caption,\nTyler Dibling scored his first Southampton goal in his 11th senior appearance\n-   Have your say on Southampton\u2019s performance\n    \n-   What did you make of Ipswich\u2019s display?\n    \n## Late drama in battle of newly promoted sides\nThis video can not be played\n## To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\nMedia caption,\nSouthampton didn't 'stick to principles' - Martin\nBoth sides remain without a league win, but Ipswich, back in the top flight for the first time since 2001-02, were the happier side as they celebrated as if they had gained a victory.\nThis hard-earned point was their third draw from five matches, losing only against Liverpool and Manchester City, and briefly moved them up from 17th to 16th, before Crystal Palace's 0-0 draw with Manchester United returned the Blues to 17th.\nSouthampton have their first point back in the top flight, which nudged them up a spot, going from 19th to 18th in the table.\nIpswich last won a top-flight match in April 2002, winning 1-0 against Middlesbrough, and will have targeted this game at St Mary's Stadium against another side that joined them in winning promotion from the Championship in 2023-24.\nBut, after a battling 0-0 draw at Brighton last week, Town boss Kieran McKenna will have been hugely frustrated at the ease in which the hosts took the lead.\nThis video can not be played\n## To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\nMedia caption,\nIpswich 'heading in the right direction'- McKenna\nLallana set up a player half his age as he provided a fine pass which Dibling controlled well to create space away from two Ipswich defenders, with the midfielder - a product of the Southampton academy - scoring his first senior goal.\nThat was the first time the Saints had led in a league match this season and they nearly doubled their advantage 22 minutes later.\nArcher took the ball around Muric but from a tight angle could only hit the base of the left-hand upright.\nThe visitors enjoyed a bright spell before the break but Aaron Ramsdale kept the Saints in front.\nDara O'Shea headed at the former Arsenal keeper, who then denied Leif Davis at the near post and spectacularly tipped over Omari Hutchinson's 22-yard effort.\nSammie Szmodics fired against the side netting when striking first time from Hutchinson's through ball as Ipswich pushed for a deserved equaliser.\nSouthampton were closing in on their first win in the Premier League since 4 March 2023, when they beat Leicester 1-0 at St Mary's, before the late drama.\nThe visitors nearly scored in seven minutes of added time but Ramsdale excellently tipped over George Hirst's effort, only for the goalkeeper to be finally beaten late on by Morsy's deflected 25-yard strike.\n\"It was a fantastic way to finish the game,\" said McKenna. \"For the captain to step up, strike it well and for the goal to come in front of the away supporters to get a point is a great thing for the group to go through.\n\"It builds on what we have done over the last few years. Scoring late goals and never giving up has been a massive part of our success so for a new group it's good for them to go through that.\n\"If you take out \\[Manchester\\] City and Liverpool in our first two games, it's three games in a row where we have been competitive.\n\"We're edging in the right direction. It's about keep developing as a team, keep improving and the points will take care of themselves.\"\n\n\nImage source, Reuters\nImage caption,\nKieran McKenna guided Ipswich Town from League One to the Premier League in successive seasons, with his side hoping they get their first top-flight win of 2024-25 on Sunday, 29 September when they entertain Aston Villa\nThe Player Rater cannot be displayed in your browser.

Archer stepped up to take the penalty but his strike was a poor one and kept out by Onana.\nFrom then on Manchester United were in full control, and while there is still clearly work to be done to iron out some issues in the team, three goals and a clean sheet is a positive return to action for Ten Hag's side.\n## Saints pay price for profligacy\nThis video can not be played\n## To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\nMedia caption,\nSouthampton 0-3 Manchester United: Russell Martin reaction\nIt has been a miserable return to the Premier League for Southampton as defeat leaves them waiting for their first points of the campaign.\nManager Russell Martin is sticking steadfastly to the attractive style of football that got them promoted from the Championship, and they should have gained some reward for their excellent start to this game.\nThe hosts produced some slick build-up play but that was undone by their inability to make it count in the final third and, in the Premier League, failure to be clinical can swiftly be punished, as it proved.\nOne notable bright spot for Southampton was the performance of Dibling. The 18-year-old midfielder made his debut and was a menace to the Manchester United defence in the first half.\nThe Player Rater cannot be displayed in your browser.

Including penalties it was 23 from 61.\nPostecoglou appeared unconcerned by this obvious weakness but another crucial goal leading to a defeat from a routine corner poorly defended should focus the manager's mind, with three of Arsenal's last four goals against Spurs coming from set plays.\nIn the wider context, there was plenty to admire in Spurs' early endeavour but the longer the game went on the more wayward they became, descending into a catalogue of poor decision-making and failures to deliver quality from good positions.\nThere was a growing sense that Arsenal would punish these flaws and so it proved, much to the frustration of Spurs fans, who created a thunderous atmosphere as Postecoglou's side opened with verve but without end product.\nThis will be a bitterly disappointing day for Postecoglou and his players as Arsenal's absentees presented them with a big opportunity to make a statement, instead they fell short once more and now have only one win from their first four league matches.\nThe Player Rater cannot be displayed in your browser.

It could have been a free-kick to us. It could have helped us. But, hey, you never know.\n\"I think the probability of scoring from a direct free-kick is like 0.0543, so probably not the biggest probability for scoring anyway.\n\"And I think John Brooks overall had a very good game. The way he handled soft fouls both ways was really good.\n\"I understand how it is. We can't be too - I don't like the word aggressive, but - in-their-face because it's just our frustration. We can't do anything about it. Hey, move on.\"\n## Spurs shrug off early setback to claim deserved win\nWith their team having made their worst start to a league season in nine years, Spurs fans may have been fearful when their side fell behind so early in the game.\nInstead, they witnessed a superb response as the hosts swarmed Brentford, forced their opponents into errors and soon equalised.\nThe pass from Pinnock was a poor one but Spurs were ready to pounce in a sequence that summed up the first 45 minutes.\nSolanke was the beneficiary on that occasion - a simple finish to get off the mark for the season - but Brentford's generosity in possession meant there were plenty of chances to go around.\n\"He was good again. I think he's been good in every game he's played for us and strikers love scoring goals,\" Postecoglou said of Solanke.\n\"A great moment for him to score his first goal for the club, particularly at home.\n\"Aside from that, again it was a really strong performance by him. I thought he led the line really well.\"\nSpurs must take plenty of credit for the way that harried their visitors and set traps to win back the ball before springing forward at pace.\nBy the time Johnson put them in front, the winger had already gone close twice, and Son burst clear and rounded Flekken, only for some uncharacteristic hesitation that led to him being crowded out.\nThere were fewer chances in a less frenetic second period, but even as Brentford pushed them back, Spurs seemed in control and remained a threat on the break.\nThat eventually brought them Maddison's clincher that, after losses to Newcastle and Arsenal, has Spurs looking up again.\n## Brentford architects of their own downfall\nFor the second week in a row, Brentford lost after taking the lead in the first 25 seconds.\nBut while there is no shame in defeats at Manchester City and Tottenham, Frank will know his side did themselves no favours in north London.\nTottenham came back at them with great intensity after Mbeumo\u2019s first-minute strike, and there is no doubt that Brentford were holding on.\nIt required some desperate defending to keep it at 1-0 for as long as they did and while Spurs' press did force Brentford to cough up possession at times, the mistakes that led to the first two goals were wholly unforced.\nOn both occasions, the ball was given away under little to no pressure and they were ruthlessly punished.\nThe Bees were much sharper after the interval, created chances and will point to the possible Vicario handball as a potential turning point.\nBut, in truth, it was their own carelessness that led to them surrendering another early lead and falling to a third league defeat of the campaign.\nThe Player Rater cannot be displayed in your browser.

He then clasped his hands together and bowed.\nThe inference being, perhaps, there was a renewed focus and a plea for forgiveness.\nPostecoglou's paternal approach with a smart piece of man-management appears to have produced the right reaction and set Bissouma on the correct path.\n\"It's a good start. He's still got work to do,\" said the Spurs boss.\n\"I'm not doubting his footballing quality. We want to make him the best version of himself.

Four goals in five Premier League games so far is a decent tally for any striker whose name does not end in 'Haaland'.\nJackson signed a contract extension until 2033 just over a week ago and it is debatable after a year at the club whether it was entirely warranted. However, he repaid some of that faith with two quality strikes here.\nThere was a sharpness and hunger to the way in which he sniffed out chances, and a cool precision about the manner in which he took them.\nThat bodes particularly well for away games against stronger opponents were goalscoring opportunities are likely to be at a premium.\nWith 10 goals in 12 London derbies, Jackson also has shown he has an eye for the occasion.\nCertainly West Ham's defence struggled to live with his fleetness of foot on the shoulder of the last defender.\nEqually, his relationship with winger Sancho - handed his full debut by Enzo Maresca here - also looks promising.\nThe pair neatly combined for Chelsea's opener and they linked up well throughout.\nJackson is starting to look the real deal.", "away_goals": 3, "away_team": "Chelsea", "home_goals": 0, "home_team": "West Ham United"}, "op_id": "df4e068ef0", "op_name": "LLMConvertBonded", "time_per_record": 1.8871312141418457, "cost_per_record": 0.0003888, "source_op_id": null, "plan_id": "d26c67e021", "model_name": "meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct-Turbo", "answer": {"away_goals": 3, "away_team": "Chelsea", "home_goals": 0, "home_team": "West Ham United"}, "input_fields": ["contents", "filename"], "generated_fields": ["away_goals", "away_team", "home_goals", "home_team"], "total_input_tokens": 1797.0, "total_output_tokens": 147.0, "total_input_cost": 0.0003594, "total_output_cost": 2.9400000000000003e-05, "filter_str": null, "passed_filter": null, "llm_call_duration_secs": 1.8846368789672852, "fn_call_duration_secs": 0.0, "failed_convert": false}, {"record_id": "f2f6259618", "record_parent_id": null, "record_state": {"_id": "f2f6259618", "_parent_id": null, "filename": "BBC Sport - Premier League 2024-2025 - West Ham United vs Aston Villa Premier League.md", "contents": "Match date: Sat 17 Aug 2024\n\u2027\nPremier League\nWest Ham United 1 , Aston Villa 2 at Full time\nWest HamWest Ham UnitedWest Ham United1\n2Aston VillaAston VillaAston Villa\nFull time\nFT\nHalf Time West Ham United 1 , Aston Villa 1\nHT 1-1\n### Key Events\n#### West Ham United\n-   Lucas Paquet\u00e1 (37' pen)Penalty 37 minutes\n#### Aston Villa\n-   A.

It means subjective decisions will not be refereed again after a decision has been made by on-field officials.\nWest Ham threw on Fullkrug, for his debut, as well as Danny Ings as they went with two up front in an attempt to find an equaliser.\nAnother substitute making his Hammers debut, former Leeds winger Crysencio Summerville, swung in an enticing cross with minutes remaining which was headed towards goal by Ings but saved by Villa goalkeeper Martinez.\nThe Hammers missed an even bigger chance to snatch a draw in the dying seconds as Soucek hooked over from close range.\nThe Player Rater cannot be displayed in your browser.

It is almost a perfect start for new manager Slot.\nAt Molineux, they rode out an early Wolves storm, in which the returning Alisson did not have a serious save to make, and slowly took control.\nWhen they did concede, they responded with five minutes - however much of a gift the penalty may have been - to return to the top.\nIt is not the heavy metal football of Jurgen Klopp's era. Perhaps it is more easy listening, given how cool Slot looks on the touchline, but the new manager is finding the right tune.\nThere were a few bum notes - Konate being caught out by Larsen for Wolves\u2019 leveller was sloppy - but Liverpool have the winning habit.\nThey have shown they can recover from setbacks, both in game and following defeats, and their trip to Emirates Stadium to face Arsenal in a month is already looming large.\n## Same again as Wolves search for a win\nThis video can not be played\n## To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\nMedia caption,\nWolves 1-2 Liverpool: Gary O'Neil 'gutted' as Wolves 'deserved more'\nGroundhog day for Wolves.

They were unacceptable \\[errors\\] from us,\" O'Neill told BBC Match of the Day.\n\"I am all for positivity and when the lads do well they know they have done well, but from all of us as a group to concede those three \\[second-half\\] goals as we do is unacceptable.\n\"If you give goals away like we did it was going to be a tough afternoon.
