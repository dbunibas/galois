Jean-Philippe Mateta had yet to score in the Premier League this season before Saturday
Matthew Howarth
BBC Sport journalist
**Jean-Philippe Mateta’s stoppage-time penalty rescued a draw for Crystal Palace as Oliver Glasner’s team fought back from two goals down to draw with Leicester City at Selhurst Park.**
Mateta calmly rolled the ball past Leicester goalkeeper Mads Hermansen in the second minute of added time, after Conor Coady hacked down Ismaila Sarr inside the area.
Jamie Vardy had opened the scoring for Leicester midway through the first half, collecting Wilfred Ndidi’s pass before rounding Dean Henderson and sliding the ball into the unguarded net.
It was 2-0 just 23 seconds into the second half, Ndidi capitalising on a poor clearance from Palace debutant Maxence Lacroix and teeing up Stephy Mavididi, who fired high into the net from close range.
Mateta’s close-range finish from Tyrick Mitchell’s low cross was allowed to stand following a video assistant referee (VAR) check, but time appeared to be running out for Palace until Coady’s lunge on Sarr gifted the Frenchman the opportunity to level the score.
Both teams remain without a win this season, but Palace will be by far the happier of the two sides after avoiding a third Premier League defeat by the skin of their teeth.

Glasner praises Palace belief after late equaliser
After holding Chelsea at Stamford Bridge last time out – and ending the summer transfer window with a late flourish – Glasner and his players will have earmarked this fixture as an opportunity to get their season up and running.
For a long time, however, it looked like being another day of frustration for Glasner, who will be satisfied with Palace’s second-half display but deeply frustrated by some of his team’s defending.
Vardy’s 21st-minute strike means the Eagles have conceded first in all four of their league games so far this term. Since the Austrian’s appointment, they are yet to win a Premier League match in which they have trailed.
Palace debutant Eddie Nketiah failed to make the scoresheet but his movement off the ball was excellent at times. He was unlucky not to make it 2-2 after Mateta - who was deemed onside from Mitchell's cross - had reduced the arrears, his rasping drive flying narrowly wide of the far post.
Lacroix, on the other hand, endured a frustrating first outing in a Palace shirt, after his misplaced clearance allowed Ndidi to square the ball for Mavididi for Leicester’s second.
Palace captain Marc Guehi was also guilty of some questionable defending in the first half, but the visitors were unable to take advantage.

Palace draw 'feels like a defeat' - Cooper
Like their opponents, Leicester went into Saturday’s game without a league win but they should have taken the lead before Vardy’s opener.
Jordan Ayew, returning to Selhurst Park for the first time since joining the Foxes from Palace last month, was left unmarked at the far post but failed to make proper contact with Mavididi’s looping cross, after the winger had dispossessed Guehi.
Vardy cut a frustrated figure against Aston Villa a fortnight ago but made no mistake to give his team the lead here, showing tremendous composure to take Ndidi’s pass in his stride and slide the ball home from a tight angle.
The veteran frontman almost turned provider before the interval, capitalising on another Guehi error before squaring for Mavididi, who failed to steer his effort on target.
Mavididi made amends in the opening minute of the second half, but it was not enough to earn the visitors a first league win of the campaign.
They defended resolutely for much of the second half, but Coady’s lunging tackle on Sarr proved costly.
