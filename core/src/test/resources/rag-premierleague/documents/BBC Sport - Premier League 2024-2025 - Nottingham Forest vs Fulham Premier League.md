Fulham striker Raul Jimenez scored his fourth goal of the season in all competitions at the City Ground

**Raul Jimenez scored his 50th Premier League goal with a clinical penalty as Fulham’s impressive start to the season continued with victory at Nottingham Forest.**
Fulham were awarded a penalty early in the second half after referee Josh Smith was urged to consult the pitchside monitor by the Video Assistant Referee (VAR).
Smith had seemingly missed the infringement but determined from the replays that Forest defender Murillo had scraped his studs along the back of Andreas Pereira’s calf.
Pereira is Fulham's designated penalty taker but Jimenez took the ball off him - amid some disagreement between the pair - and emphatically buried the spot-kick.
The goal opened up what had hitherto been a tight contest as the directness and tricky skills of Forest substitutes Callum Hudson-Odoi and Anthony Elanga gave the home side greater purpose.
Hudson-Odoi went close after a mazy dribble when he cut in from the left, but could only lift his shot over the crossbar while Fulham keeper Bernd Leno had his palms stung by a spectacular volleyed effort from Jota Silva.
Jimenez went close to scoring a second when he curled wide from a good position before Marco Silva's side showed composure to see off Forest's late pressure.
Fulham's victory was their third of the season and helped them climb up to sixth in the table - just four points off leaders Liverpool.

## Jimenez hits half-century
Jimenez plundered 13 and 17 goals in his first two Premier League campaigns while at Wolves between 2018 and 2020.
His goalscoring returns since suffering a fractured his skull which threatened to end his career in November 2020 have, however, been relatively modest.
There has always been the unerring sense that the psychological baggage of such a shocking injury – which kept him out for more than seventh months - meant Jimenez would never be the same player again.
The fact he is still playing, thanks to a special head protector, is testament to a love of the game.
To see him reach a half-century of goals in England’s top-flight is heartening.
Jimenez emphatically notched his 50th from the penalty spot, stuttering with his run-up to deceive Forest goalkeeper Matz Sels before carefully placing it into the net.
He was unlucky not to have scored a second later in the game.
Former Manchester United striker Javier Hernandez (53) is the only Mexican with more goals in the Premier League and Jimenez will surely overtake that milestone.
Three goals in his last four appearances – and nine in his past 10 league starts – hints at a striker on the cusp of the kind of hot streak he produced when he burst into English football.
Shortly after the final whistle Jimenez peeled off his Fulham shirt and ran over to the away supporters.
He presented his shirt to a dumbfounded Fulham fan wearing a Mexico national team top. At 33, Jimenez is clearly relishing every moment.
