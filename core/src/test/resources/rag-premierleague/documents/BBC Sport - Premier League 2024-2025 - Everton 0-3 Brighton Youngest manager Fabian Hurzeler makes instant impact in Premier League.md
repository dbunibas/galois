Fabian Hurzeler reacts to the Seagulls' big win

**Brighton's young manager Fabian Hurzeler started his Premier League career with an impressive win that meant Everton began their final season at Goodison Park in miserable fashion.**
The venue has been Everton's home ground since 1892, but they will move to a new stadium at Bramley-Moore Dock for the start of next season.
Thirty-one-year-old Hurzeler became the Premier League's youngest ever permanent manager and his Brighton side were in no mood to provide any sentiment towards the opposition.
"It is a very good feeling, but I don't want to talk about myself so much," said Hurzeler. "The players, club and staff deserve this win. They worked quite hard in pre-season and I am very proud and happy for them."
Tackles flew in during a thunderous first half in which Everton's Jack Harrison had an early goal ruled out for offside, while at the other end Joao Pedro rattled the post with a stinging low drive.
The visitors took the lead courtesy of Kaoru Mitoma's easy finish at the back post following fine work from debutant Yankuba Minteh, who was heavily linked with a move to Everton before joining Brighton this summer.
Everton had a penalty award overturned at the start of the second half despite Lewis Dunk appearing to catch Dominic Calvert-Lewin, as referee Simon Hooper reviewed the incident on the pitchside monitor.
Feeling hard done by, Everton were then punished further as Idrissa Gueye misplaced a pass in midfield, allowing the Seagulls to counter, and Danny Welbeck stroked in a lovely finish from the edge of the box.
Everton's Ashley Young was sent off as the last man for pulling back Japan international Mitoma, and Simon Adingra slid home a third goal late on to inflict a thoroughly desperate opening defeat on the home side.

## Mitoma the star of the show

Eyebrows were raised during the summer when Brighton replaced the experienced Roberto de Zerbi, who left by mutual agreement, with relative unknown Hurzeler as their new manager.
The German had achieved success in his homeland by guiding St Pauli into the Bundesliga and it was enough for the Seagulls to take a chance on his services.
At 31 years and 173 days old, German Hurzeler became the youngest permanent manager of a Premier League team and the first boss to be born after the competition started in 1992.
The former Germany youth international gave debuts to summer signings Minteh and Mats Wieffer, but it was the inclusion of veteran James Milner that initially sparked the most interest.
The ex-Liverpool and Manchester City utility man signed a new contract in the summer and is seven years older than his boss, while his selection allowed him to appear in the Premier League for a record 23rd campaign.
Hurzeler was just nine years of age when Milner made his Premier League debut in November 2002.
It was Milner's team-mate Mitoma who was the star of the show, running Everton defenders ragged throughout and capping his superb performance with a goal.
The tricky winger could have had more goals, but a poked effort and a low drive were kept out by England international Jordan Pickford.
The joyous travelling fans thought they were celebrating a fourth goal in injury time but substitute Yasin Ayari's effort from close range was chalked off for offside, though it did not dampen their spirits as they were left singing at full-time.
Hurzeler said: "It was a good result. It was a tough game, especially the first minutes. It was really intense and a loud atmosphere and we suffered in some moments, but we defended quite good. After that we tried to control the game and we had very good chances.
"We went 1-0 up and then it was helpful for us to control the game and have ball possession. In the end, a clean sheet is so important to win games in the Premier League and everyone was responsible today in defending their own box.
"It showed the attitude and character of the players so I am very happy for them. It was a good start, nothing more, and now we try to keep working to stay humble after a win like this."

Sean Dyche responds after a tough day for the Toffees
## Another season of struggle for Everton?
This may yet become a celebratory season for Everton, aiming to bid farewell to their much-loved home ground in style, but at the end of Saturday's game there were no cheers ringing out from home sections.
Instead, jeers echoed around Goodison from the hardened supporters who remained until the final whistle, as the heavy defeat left the Toffees slumped at the bottom of the table after their first game.
Sean Dyche's side have battled at the wrong end of the table for the last three campaigns and early signs point to perhaps another season of struggle.
The game could have panned out differently had Harrison's early strike stood, but in truth Everton were second best for much of the contest and failed to force Brighton goalkeeper Jason Steele into any meaningful saves.
Everton could have had a penalty but referee Hooper changed his mind after being asked by the video assistant referee to review his decision. He ruled in Brighton's favour, despite it appearing as though the main VAR monitor was not functioning correctly, with Hooper said to have had a back-up screen available.
Dyche said: "The way we performed in the first half was decent and as good as I was hoping for, but one of the biggest challenges is finding the clinical moments which we didn't do.
"A big decision on the penalty - I can't really work it out. We go to these meetings, we have literally been told the bar is going to be incredibly high for the referee to make a decision; he makes a clear decision from a perfect viewing point and lo and behold he is called over to overturn the decision.
"You are like, what is the point having a high bar then? We are all confused by it."
Midfielder Tim Iroegbunam stuck to his task and had a shot that curled wide in the opening period, while fellow debutant Iliman Ndiaye was unable to make an impact when brought on with half an hour remaining as Everton began with a disheartening loss.
