**Newcastle United missed the opportunity to move top of the Premier League as Fulham ended the visitors' unbeaten start with a performance full of purpose and intent.**
Fulham took an early lead when Raul Jimenez's sharp turn and finish, just 44 seconds after Joelinton had a goal for Newcastle ruled out by an offside flag.
Summer signing Emile Smith Rowe continued his fine start at the Cottagers by doubling the lead with a low shot which squirmed under away keeper Nick Pope.
Newcastle, who mustered only one shot on target in an insipid first-half performance, narrowed the gap through Harvey Barnes within 28 seconds of the restart.
But while the Magpies posed more threat, they were unable to find an equaliser as Fulham held out.
Fabian Schar came the closest when he blasted into the side-netting after capitalising on a slack pass by Fulham keeper Bernd Leno.
The home side had chances to restore their two-goal advantage in an even second half but did not seal victory until stoppage time.
Newcastle captain Bruno Guimaraes' woeful clearance went straight to Reiss Nelson in the penalty area and the substitute emphatically fired in to secure Fulham's second league win.
Newcastle drop to sixth in a Premier League table still shaping up on gameweek five, with Fulham moving up to eighth as their solid start continues.

## Smith Rowe thriving as Fulham's forwards click
One of the key factors behind Fulham's impressive display was 24-year-old Smith Rowe.
In the summer, the one-time England international decided he needed a fresh start away from Arsenal after being stalled by injury problems.
A move across London to Fulham looked a logical step and another productive performance reinforced it was the right one.
Smith Rowe was a regular threat with his ball-carrying and ingenuity around the opposition box, hitting the bar before a neat one-two with former Arsenal team-mate Alex Iwobi led to his goal.
A standing ovation from Craven Cottage as Smith Rowe left the pitch indicated the impact he has already made.
"I'm really confident at the moment and comfortable with everything. I've got to keep going and keep working hard," he said.
"Everyone knows it has been a tough couple of seasons for me. I have to stay fit and I feel good at the moment. I'm feeling confident and happy."

Fulham 3-1 Newcastle United: Silva on feeling clear and deserving 'more points'
Smith Rowe's performance was not the only positive for Fulham.
Seasoned Mexico striker Jimenez has taken his chance after being restored as a starter ahead of Rodrigo Muniz, while Adama Traore's pace offered another threat in a formidable front four.
Fulham have paid the price for being wasteful this season - notably in an opening-day defeat at Manchester United and last weekend's draw against West Ham.
So the way in which they saw off Newcastle was a source of pride for boss Marco Silva.
"It was a great, great first half and we created many problems for them," he said.
"It was the same against West Ham - we scored just one when we should have scored three or four. This was the same.
"In the Premier League you have to be clinical. But the performances are good and you can see how this team is growing. We have been showing quality."
## Newcastle unable to muster another late flurry
With Manchester City and Arsenal playing on Sunday, Newcastle knew they could temporarily jump to the top of the table - an encouraging sight if not a realistic sign of where Eddie Howe's side are at.
Even though they had not lost in their opening four league games, there remained a strong sense the Magpies were still far from their best.
That view were substantiated in a first half during which Newcastle lacked solidity in their defensive shape and assurance on the ball to stem the tide.
"It was a slow start and the first goal was a killer blow for us," said Howe.
A disjointed display left cause for concern and Howe reacted by making a double change at the break.
Jacob Murphy, who was introduced alongside Lewis Hall, made an immediate impact by driving forward with the pace and purpose his side had lacked.
A measured pass into the path of Barnes, supporting on Murphy’s left, allowed the winger to calmly cut inside before drilling into the bottom corner.
Belief was back. Newcastle continued to play with more urgency and clarity to leave the game delicately poised.
Late goals have been a common theme in their encouraging start, leading to the back-to-back wins against Tottenham and Wolves.
However, they were unable to grab another and missed the chance to go unbeaten in their opening five top-flight matches for the first time since 2011-12.
"Games swing on big moments," Howe said when asked about Schar not taking his chance to level.
"The character and attitude was better in that second period but we have to learn our lessons from the first half."
