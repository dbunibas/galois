How 'brilliant' Newcastle substitutes turned game against Wolves
Nick Mashiter
BBC Sport football news reporter
**Harvey Barnes' stunning strike maintained Newcastle's unbeaten start after the Magpies came from behind to win at Wolves.**
The winger, on as a substitute, curled in from 20 yards with 10 minutes left soon after Fabian Schar had levelled.
Mario Lemina's first goal since February gave the hosts the lead but Gary O'Neil's side remain winless from their opening four games.
Newcastle started strongly and Wolves keeper Sam Johnstone tipped Jacob Murphy's shot over after the winger burst through, prompting an animated discussion between O'Neil and defender Craig Dawson.
The visitors continued to make the early running and Anthony Gordon hit the post when he ghosted past Nelson Semedo and nutmegged Yerson Mosquera.
But Wolves settled and Lemina put them ahead nine minutes before half-time, sweeping in Jorgen Strand Larsen's cross after Joao Gomes' cute dummy.
Newcastle manager Eddie Howe had seen enough and sent on Barnes, Sandro Tonali and Joe Willock for Alexsandar Isak, Sean Longstaff and Joelinton at the break.
Yet the changes failed to have an immediate impact and, after Johnstone saved Bruno Guimaraes' strike, Strand Larsen came close to doubling Wolves' lead when he hit the post after 52 minutes.
Nick Pope denied Strand Larsen and Matheus Cunha but Schar levelled with 15 minutes left when his 30-yard effort clipped Craig Dawson and flew in before Barnes' superb goal won it.
Pope denied Cunha a stoppage-time leveller and Barnes could have added a third for Newcastle, only to dink wide with just Johnstone to beat.

MOTD 2: Debate and analysis on the 'disappearance' of long range goals
## Unity for Newcastle key after disappointing summer
At the end of the transfer window Eddie Howe did not argue about his squad being weaker than this time last year.
The free transfer of Lloyd Kelly from Bournemouth and arrivals of young forward William Osula and goalkeeper Odysseas Vlachodimos did little to excite, especially after the failed pursuit of Marc Guehi from Crystal Palace.
Fastforward two weeks and Newcastle are unbeaten, third in the early Premier League table and being serenaded off the Molineux pitch by the travelling fans after a comeback win.
At times Newcastle were underwhelming but a piece of brilliance from Barnes took the points and there was a clear sense of unity at the final whistle.
That unity has been in question after a disappointing window and the arrival of Paul Mitchell as sporting director, who criticised the club's previous transfer strategy as "unfit for purpose."
The TV cameras kept cutting to Mitchell in the stands but Howe, who has denied any internal problems, has been able to stamp out any alternative narrative with an unbeaten start.

## Wolves still showing promise despite defeat
Wolves boss Gary O'Neil may feel like a broken record after a narrow defeat.
It may be four winless games to open the Premier League season but it was another performance which promised enough to suggest there will not be long-term problems.
Yet, with Aston Villa, Liverpool, Brentford and Manchester City awaiting in the Premier League, time may not be on their side should the rough patch continue into October.
O'Neil says Wolves remain the underdogs in the Premier League and they need time to settle following the end of the transfer window.
There is enough quality in the Wolves squad - and they have more depth than last season - to dig themselves out of any future hole they may find themselves in.
Striker Strand Larsen has shown glimpses, midfielder Andre had an bustling full debut and keeper Johnstone will prove a shrewd buy from Crystal Palace.
Wolves do need to arrest their disappointing start but no-one is hitting the panic button yet.
