## Positives for Ipswich but win still elusive

Ipswich created best chances - McKenna
Ipswich were decent value for their point, which lifted them out of the relegation zone.
Their wait for a first win since returning to the Premier League goes on, although manager Kieran McKenna will take positives from this latest display.
Delap's two goals were both well taken but quite different in execution.
His first was a predatory first-time strike from inside the penalty area and his second was all of his own making, reminiscent of his first Premier League goal for Ipswich in the 1-1 draw against Fulham on 31 August.
The 21-year-old perhaps should have had a hat-trick, but Martinez denied him when he was sent through for a one-on-one in the first period.
Kalvin Phillips had a hand in Ipswich's opener, winning a turnover deep in the Villa half before feeding Clarke to set up Delap.
England international Phillips also tested Martinez with a stinging drive from outside the penalty area.
Of concern to McKenna will be the defensive lapses that led to two soft goals at the other end.
Ipswich's next four league fixtures are against teams currently outside the top 10, so hopes of a first league win of the campaign arriving soon will be high - especially if Delap can continue this fine start to his career in Suffolk.

Emery 'not happy' but says draw was 'fair' result
Villa came from a goal behind to beat Wolves 3-1 in their previous Premier League outing, a week after fighting back from a two-goal deficit to defeat Everton at Villa Park.
That pattern looked like continuing on Sunday, once the visitors had recovered from their early setback.
The form of England hopeful Rogers, 22, has been among the major recent positives for Villa and he found the net for the first time at club level this season with a composed finish from inside the box.
England forward Watkins' header was his fourth league goal in his last three games and put Villa on course for what would have been a fifth win in six Premier League outings in 2024-25.
They appeared comfortable in spells, but this was another game in which Villa were unable to show their best form for a full 90 minutes and on this occasion they could not take away all three points.
Villa's attention will now turn to two blockbuster home games in five days.
Unai Emery's side host German giants Bayern Munich in the Champions League on Wednesday (20:00 BST), before Manchester United visit Villa Park for a Premier League fixture on Sunday (14:00 BST).
