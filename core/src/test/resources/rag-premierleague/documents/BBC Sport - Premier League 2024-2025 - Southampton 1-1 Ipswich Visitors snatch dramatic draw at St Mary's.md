Sam Morsy's equaliser was his first goal for Ipswich since scoring in the 1-1 draw with Leicester on 26 December
Michael Emons
BBC Sport journalist
**Southampton manager Russell Martin said he was "really angry and annoyed" after Ipswich Town captain Sam Morsy scored a dramatic injury-time equaliser to deny the Saints their first Premier League win of the season.**
The hosts had been beaten in all of their first four top-flight games of 2024-25, but pounced on a mistake from the visitors to take the lead after only five minutes through Tyler Dibling's first goal for the club.
Ipswich's Axel Tuanzebe lost possession inside his penalty area and Southampton kept the ball well, with 36-year-old Adam Lallana setting up 18-year-old Dibling, and the teenager calmly slotted past Arijanet Muric.
Cameron Archer missed a penalty in the 3-0 loss to Manchester United last Saturday and almost doubled the Saints' lead, but hit the post.
Archer, searching for his first Saints goal since his £15m move from Aston Villa in the summer, had another chance when played in by ex-Ipswich midfielder Flynn Downes, but Muric saved well.
But that miss proved costly as Morsy, in the 95th minute, shot past Aaron Ramsdale from outside the penalty area, with the effort taking a deflection off the unfortunate Joe Aribo.
"I'm really angry and frustrated that we haven't seen the game out and really disappointed for everyone," said Martin.
"We allowed them a header just before the corner where they scored from the second phase. We didn't stick to our principles in the details and that's about having enough experience to get through and we didn't do it.
"There was so much good stuff but the overriding feeling is being disappointed. We made a few fundamental errors that we haven't done in training so it has to be down to the anxiety.
"It was our best performance, but it wasn't enough to get the win so I'm allowed to be angry and annoyed."

Southampton didn't 'stick to principles' - Martin
Both sides remain without a league win, but Ipswich, back in the top flight for the first time since 2001-02, were the happier side as they celebrated as if they had gained a victory.
This hard-earned point was their third draw from five matches, losing only against Liverpool and Manchester City, and briefly moved them up from 17th to 16th, before Crystal Palace's 0-0 draw with Manchester United returned the Blues to 17th.
Southampton have their first point back in the top flight, which nudged them up a spot, going from 19th to 18th in the table.
Ipswich last won a top-flight match in April 2002, winning 1-0 against Middlesbrough, and will have targeted this game at St Mary's Stadium against another side that joined them in winning promotion from the Championship in 2023-24.
But, after a battling 0-0 draw at Brighton last week, Town boss Kieran McKenna will have been hugely frustrated at the ease in which the hosts took the lead.

Ipswich 'heading in the right direction'- McKenna
Lallana set up a player half his age as he provided a fine pass which Dibling controlled well to create space away from two Ipswich defenders, with the midfielder - a product of the Southampton academy - scoring his first senior goal.
That was the first time the Saints had led in a league match this season and they nearly doubled their advantage 22 minutes later.
Archer took the ball around Muric but from a tight angle could only hit the base of the left-hand upright.
The visitors enjoyed a bright spell before the break but Aaron Ramsdale kept the Saints in front.
Dara O'Shea headed at the former Arsenal keeper, who then denied Leif Davis at the near post and spectacularly tipped over Omari Hutchinson's 22-yard effort.
Sammie Szmodics fired against the side netting when striking first time from Hutchinson's through ball as Ipswich pushed for a deserved equaliser.
Southampton were closing in on their first win in the Premier League since 4 March 2023, when they beat Leicester 1-0 at St Mary's, before the late drama.
The visitors nearly scored in seven minutes of added time but Ramsdale excellently tipped over George Hirst's effort, only for the goalkeeper to be finally beaten late on by Morsy's deflected 25-yard strike.
"It was a fantastic way to finish the game," said McKenna. "For the captain to step up, strike it well and for the goal to come in front of the away supporters to get a point is a great thing for the group to go through.
"It builds on what we have done over the last few years. Scoring late goals and never giving up has been a massive part of our success so for a new group it's good for them to go through that.
"If you take out \[Manchester\] City and Liverpool in our first two games, it's three games in a row where we have been competitive.
"We're edging in the right direction. It's about keep developing as a team, keep improving and the points will take care of themselves."
