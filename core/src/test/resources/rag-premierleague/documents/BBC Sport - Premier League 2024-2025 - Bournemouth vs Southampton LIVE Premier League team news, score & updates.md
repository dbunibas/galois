## Semenyo stars against charitable Saints
As well as Bournemouth played to establish and extend their early advantage, they were also aided considerably by some naive and charitable Southampton defending.
And given that has been a recurring theme of Saints' return to the top flight after a one-year absence, it is only likely to add to the pressure on Martin.
Not only have his side managed a meagre three goals this term - the lowest in the Premier League - only Everton and Wolves have conceded more than the 12 goals they have shipped to date.
Harwood-Bellis was caught on his heels for Bournemouth's opener, with several of his team-mates not even facing the ball, let alone positioning themselves to prevent Tavernier's lofted delivery.
The visitors were also far too passive when dealing with Bournemouth's second and third goals.
Five defenders obscured Ramsdale's view but did little to get out to block Cook’s initial effort for the second, while the elusive Semenyo - a threat all game - was allowed to turn one way and then another by four Saints players before dispatching an effort that travelled through the legs of Harwood-Bellis on its way into the net.
Bournemouth will hope to use this performance and result as a stepping stone to better things when they travel to Leicester on Saturday (15:00 BST), with Iraola set to be back in the dugout after serving a touchline ban.
However, Southampton go to title hopefuls Arsenal with the daunting task of trying to arrest the form that has brought their joint worst ever start to a league campaign - they also one point at the same stage in 1998-99 in the top-flight, and stayed up.
